Books_5,2,CG,"Winner of a bevy of national publications, the book is a refreshing glimpse into a period of the past.  The story is told from a very different point of view.  In his first published novel, John Gorman, a young British soldier from the early days of the war, is forced to flee to France to escape the Nazi occupation.  When he is rescued, he is told he is a spy for the Gestapo and is on his way to a Nazi concentration camp.  The story is told from a very different point of view, which is why I recommend it.  The book is a delightful read, and I especially enjoy the characters.  The book is filled with references to other books and to a few other writers.  I can't recommend it enough.  I was very impressed by the writing style of the author.  I would recommend this book to anyone.I really enjoyed the book.  I didn't get a good read.

I've bought several other sets and this one was the first one I bought. The colors are a little off but it's perfect. It is well made and it's very well made.

The only downside is that it's very small. The mount is designed to be a little too large for a regular tripod. It's not a huge deal, but it is very heavy for such a small mount.

The only downside I can think of is that the auto-focus ring has a tendency to lose focus. I tried to reset it by putting it on the tripod, and it will not do that. I don't know why. I've tried other options, but I just couldn't get it to work.

I do recommend it to anyone looking for a tripod.This is a great product.  I have to say it works perfectly for my camera.  I had a few issues with it, but the only one I have was that the charger would not charge the battery on my camera.

Cons:

The movie version is very good. The author does a great job of explaining how the German army fought in the last days of World War II. The book is great, but I think the author is putting too much emphasis on the very first part of the book. It is not a great book, but it is worth reading. I read this book in the middle of a work day and was hooked. I read it to my son, and I loved it. I also read it to my daughter who was a child. I loved the way the characters portrayed the war.

Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"With 13 cats; this is a must-have in our house. I've read negative reviews, the problem being they are using the wrong product. There are two: Feliway Comfort Zone and Feliway with CEVA. The Comfort Zone is good for mildly nervous cats. You need the Ceva for aggression, spraying and other behaviors of this type. For those who complain that it doesn't last 30 days; buy a timer. We have an atomizer in every one of our 14 rooms. We have them all on a set up of 'one hour on; 4 hours off', it makes them last much longer and they are still very effective. All of our cats have been abused, abandoned or something equally upsetting. Bringing a new cat with issues into a house full of cats with issues would be impossible without this product. I do wish they were less expensive; but we need them, so we buy them."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2,OR,"Very disappointed for three reasons. 1) A small atomic weapon is required to open the packaging.  2) The hose is very stiff.  That makes the hand-held part difficult to maneuver and also transmits motion to the  head bracket.  And 3) the hose connectors are absolutely smooth and thus impossible to tighten by hand.  And the use of any tool will mar the finish.  At least one other model apparently has ""ridged connectors"" because the directions which came with mine refers to them.

I wonder if it was not Water Pik's intention to punish me for buying an inexpensive model?

From what I saw in the store (mine was not purchased from Amazon) the packaging is such that you cannot see the hose and connector type until you have purchased the thing and somehow have managed to open it."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I really enjoyed Vincent and Danai's  book very much, it was well written and erotic. The chemistry and sex was hot and sensual. I was glad Vicent did not married Gemma, I really did not like her.  The plot was awesome, Vincent and Danai were good together.  I received this book for an Arc review."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,2,OR,After I received these I realized that they go on the outside of the window. This will not work for my applications. I do like the maple leaf look so I was sad. I am sending this to the thrift shop and hope someone else can use it!
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I love this product by Chamberlain, BUT!! please be aware if you purchase this product used and the person who previously owned it did not properly close there account THIS WILL NOT WORK! and you will be out the cost. Chamberlain cannot override their password so unless you know the person and can have them release the product for you to use, Do not buy it used. This happened to me and I can say that the Chamberlain representative was very pleasant and very helpful. They explained it to me and said all they could do was send me a new one, which they did. THANK YOU CHAMBERLAIN!! I highly recommend this product and the company!
I hope this helps some of you avoid this problem..."
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"My betta doesn't use it, but I don't think that it is a reflection on the quality of the product. It is bendable and nice looking. Serves its purpose."
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"This had a lot of good tips  and basic information on how to survive,
was a good little book that I enjoyed very much"
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"This is an action packed, comical, entertaining movie to watch, worth while to buy even for a woman, fun to watch!"
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"This is a great ball for all ages - I purchased it for a four year old's birthday and it was a hit. I have to say, I went looking all over the ball for directions and you don't need any. Just throw the ball and it flips to the different colored side as if by magic. And it makes a very satisfying sound. It is light enough for a kid to throw and there isn't a requirement to twist or turn any special way, so they won't get frustrated."
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"We did receive this product for review.  After receiving our ""Jungle Crew Lab Set"", we couldn't wait to start our experiments! At first glance, the lab set is adorable. The bright colors and fun jungle animal theme are attractive to my 6-year olds eye. The 6-piece set includes all plastic and rubber pieces, which makes this incredibly kid-friendly. Not to mention the easy-to-use test tubes include easy-to-poor tops that make it effortless to combine liquids.
Also included is activity cards. The most appealing part of the set is that all activities use household and basic craft items. This leaves hours of keeping my 6-year-old occupied and interested in learning! He is thrilled to have his own lab set that we can use over and over."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2,OR,"I tried a few of these to keep around as extras if I lose my good one or is I have people training with me that didn't bring gear. Pretty thin and flimsy, also quite small. OK enough for a temp or for weightlifting but not something I would want to spar hard with at all."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,It is great fun flying this around inside or outside the house. Be careful flying outside. It climbs very fast and really easy to lose it. Product came very fast and on time. Price was good.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"We purchased this for our 2003 Club Car.  Our cart has the standard size roof, flip down rear seat and 6 inch lift kit with huge tires.  This cover fit very will with room to spare from front to back and covers the tires and wheels.  Couldn't be happier."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I absolutely love this new author. I think he has a big future in the world of fantasy. I so much enjoyed the complexity of the plot and the wonderful uniqueness of the world and characters created in all three books of The Trinity Saga I have read so far. The idea of the stone angels, Nemuri, that rule the underworld, their connection to the watch keepers, the three princesses and their guardian knights, the forest made out of memories that light up, the identity of Pandora, it all took me on a wonderful journey where I savored every page. I tend to evaluate fantasy authors on the uniqueness and the beauty of the world they unroll for us,and the intelligence of overall design - Ronnell D.Porter passed with flying colors. I read a lot of fantasy and consider myself picky within the genre; it is difficult for me to find the author who has it all and settle with the book, so I am totally rejoiced with discovering this one.
On the matter of typos: there are a lot, but no more than in an average advanced reader copy. I wish them gone, but I have noticed that the author is donating all the proceeds from the books to the Breast Cancer and Save The Children foundations and professional editors cost a lot."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,They fit tightly and a little difficult to get on however they never fall off.  They look good and do the job well.  After they eventually wear out I will purchase the same product again.  Priced to sell also.
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"I saw the original film when it hit the theatres as a preview for public school history classes when I was teaching in San Antonio somewhere in early 70's. I was entranced by Christopher Plummer's rendition of the trusting Incan ruler. For its time, the film-making was spectacular. More importantly, the film was an important one--one of the first to reveal the cruel treatment of natives."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"Very solid build. High quality.
There will a learning curve for me to use it properly and effectively."
Beauty_5,5,OR,Good!!creamy and smooth texture.Glides on the lips easily.Will definitely recommend.
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"Great compact dishes for any size dog or cat, bunny etc
I hook them to my pocketbook or carrier.
I have a service dog and purchased them to have for her on a long airplane flight."
Electronics_5,2,OR,"Bought it for my 11.6in chromebook .. its too loose inside and feels and looks bad.
Its a very light grade of neoprene it at all"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3,OR,"I purchased this shoe from 6pm.com for $22.99. I wear a size 7 shoe. I bought the size 7. I love Ryka because they seem to fit true to size and are well priced. I love the style of these slip on shoes. I bought the brown/ bronze color. The shoe was slightly short. Not uncomfortably so, but I like room for a sock liner. Not with this shoe. The worst thing about the shoe is that dip in the heel. Somehow that dip makes the sides of the shoe gape open. Noticeably too. I don't know how the shoe would do with a wide foot. My feet are medium width. There was no side support with these shoes.  They looked like I was wearing a shapeless bedroom slipper. I'm returning them. Three stars because they're lightweight, great material, beautiful color and I like the slip on style."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Works as expected for connecting CCTV power supply to cameras.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,I love Minnetonka shoes! They always look refreshing and no one else has them!
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I bought this for a gift. My husband was very happy with it. Nice size, worked as expected. Good price - I looked around and bought here."
Pet_Supplies_5,2,OR,These aren't worth a dollar. Had to invest in a real salinity tester
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Best keyboard cover I've had to date. Laptop keys still have a little bit of ""give"", which I like, and the material just feels nice on the fingertips. Will buy more once I'll wear this one out."
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"It's always fun to find a new author to enjoy!  This second in the BBB series was just as good as the first book.  Both leads were very likeable, the secondary characters were fabulous, and the storyline flowed smoothly with easily solved conflicts.

I'm subtracting a half star, though, because I came across 30+ grammar-type errors.  None of them were significant to the story or the meaning of a sentence, just small things like using the wrong tense, the wrong spelling for sound-alike words, or leaving out or adding in extra words incorrectly.  These errors should have been proof-read out before publishing ... and I'm disappointed they weren't.

I still recommend this story if you enjoy a good storyline with some delicious intimate scenes, a H who's a little, I mean a lot, rough around the edges and a sweet and mature h.  Both are beautiful, inside and out, if a little broken by their life experiences.  Which is a great segue to the beautiful cover ... WOUZA! ... that is a scrumptious match to Evie's description of Daryk.  Love when the cover art actually depicts a physical likeness to the character in the book, even down to the tats. Now I guess it's time to admit that I stopped reading several, ok - lots of, times to 'refresh my memory' LOL!"
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Loved this musical...I've always been intrigued by children's voices, having directed their plays and choirs.  I continue to follow Jean-Baptiste Maunier's career."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Having lost my mom to this disease, I found this movie truthfully illustrates the struggle.  And if you haven't already,  read the book!"
Pet_Supplies_5,1,OR,"I hate it because it arrived broken, and to get a replacement or refund I have to return it.  It was $17 - not worth my time to take it to UPS or the post office so I'm tossing it.  Bad quality control.  I have no idea if it would work and I probably won't find out."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,I think the mice were cool. The mice were amazing. The mouse was awesome. Even though the end of this book is petty.
Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,Slow but gets there; wish this story could  be true somewhere- two main characters truly come across as made for each other- now that's hot.
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,Lots of bouncing going every which way so dog has fun chasing it .
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"Best building block toys ever! We have lincon logs, lego's, mega blocks, plain old blocks, foam blocks and for the most part this items just sit around taking up space. but not the Magna Tiles. My daughter has used her Magna Tiles at least once a day for the past 10 months and that is saying a LOT!  My daughter was not yet 3 when we got them and she closing in on 4 now-she still loves them and build with them daily. We felt it was money well spent (they are pricey) and even invested in two more sets so she could do more elaborate builds. Worth the price. We are finally going go donate our tinker toys, lincoln logs, mega blocks etc. and just keep these-these are all she uses anyway."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"Great stove. Easy to clean (when needed). Easy to maintain in the field. Parts are plentiful everywhere in the world. This stove will burn just about any fuel you want to put into it, though I don't suggest kerosene or gasoline. I bought this stove and used it faithfully for 20 years. I updated my stove recently to a Snow Peak Giga-Power with auto-ignite. Despite loving my new stove very much, I keep this stove and still use it from time to time on cold day hikes to boil water for tea. It has NEVER failed me in over 20 years no matter what I put it through.

If you are looking for lightweight backpacking stove and you may be traveling with a few people or overseas this may be a great choice for you.

If you want less weight and don't mind a slightly longer boil time (per qt), go with the Giga-Power with auto ignite by Snow Peak. The fuel canisters are readily available at most backpacking stores or online. I can boil water for tea (for myself) and all 3 meals for 3 full days and nights on one of the small canisters (8oz. or so) in moderate to fair weather. They weigh less than the liquid fuel+bottle you would be carrying with the MSR Whisperlite. Still a great stove hence the 5 star rating."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,This is a great over shirt for a plain onsie. It doesn't look like a dress and my son wears it a lot. It's double sided so it makes for a nice bib and you can turn it around and not have to look at any mess that's made too far from a change of clothes.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Seems to be good quality, easy to install, fitted perfectly in my 6 inch kitchen duct. Hopefully this will prevent the horrible smells that come from Indian food cooking in condo downstairs. My guess is that it would need to be replaced at some point because of all the grease entering kitchen hood"
Beauty_5,1,OR,It makes my skin darker so expensive and useless product.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"This is my first Super Tinker after using up 2 Tinkers and a couple of others. I'm a mechanic and general tinkerer and very hard on knives. The standard Tinker is nice and light and thin, but I found myself missing the scissors and went for this after finally destroying my last Tinker (abuse - my fault). The Super is not much larger than the Tinker, but I wouldn't keep either loose in my pocket for long. I find hanging them in my pocket from a key ring/belt clip saves my clothing and makes it harder to lose the knife.
  These knives are incredibly useful as a mini tool kit. I use the screwdrivers constantly, the awl makes a great drill, and the blades hold an edge pretty well. I often use the tweezers for removing splinters and deer ticks. It takes a substantial amount of force to break these knives (I figured out how much). So far I haven't used the scissors very often, but they are well made and work well.
  The toothpick is rather goofy, but I guess it's traditional to have one. The parcel hook has been useless so far, and I'd have preferred a file or something else. That said, I can't imagine not carrying a Swiss Army knife, and it's sad to have to leave it home sometimes because of increased security screening in some locations. Such is modern life."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"Did a lot of looking before purchasing.  Teva is a very good brand and has a lot of different styles.  I was looking for something that could do double duty on sand, water and walking.  I liked the color combination of this one along with the style.  Has the ability to make the instep area tighter or looser as necessary and the heel area is velcro and can be lengthened or shortened if need be.  The strap across the foot is also ajustable for making just the right fit.  I have a slight issue on the inside near the big toe area where my toe nail hits a seam but I'm hoping that additional wear will break them in. (and yes I have clipped my nails!)  Cute and comfy."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I began a blog a little bit ago, and it wasn't working the exact way that I wanted it to. In order get better at designing my site I needed to learn HTML. This book caught my eye because to learn everything in one day seemed like to good to be true. This book begins with the basics, helping you to understand why to use html. The next part of the book is about the different things that you can do. Some of the things it talks about is the best way to make lists, creating specific text type, formatting links, even adding images and tables. I might not have learned everything in one day, but this was definitely worth the read. It will be one that stays in my reference section."
Beauty_5,5,OR,It's very classy compared to other top brands. And not so expensive.
Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"This is an especially good young person's movie. It's an engaging, fun, and entertaining way to involve children in the basic philosophical issue of ontology. Ontology is the study of what it means to exist, or in the case of ""Short Circuit,"" what it means to be alive. Note Ren Descarte's (1596-1650) famous statement in Latin, ""Cogito, ergo sum."" (I think, therefore I am.)

Regarding the Blu-ray transfer quality controversy, the version I just bought, in Feb. of 2009, had a sticker on its wrapper that says, ""New Hi-Def Transfer."" Although this movie's video quality is not as good as ""The Fifth Element,"" ""The Fountain,"" or ""Ice Age: The Meltdown;"" ""Short Circuit"" strikes me as being close to average for Blu-ray. One complicating factor is that much of ""Short Circuit"" was shot with low contrast, so inherently, its sharpness seems somewhat low."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I am not quite to the uncomfortable stage of my pregnancy yet but the belt fits well and I think it will help a lot.
It seems like exactly what I needed for my previous pregnancy to alleviate low down ligament pain and to help carry some of the baby belly weight."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Not impossible to put together by yourself. Only scratched one place in a not very noticeable place. Get many compliments on it and has lots of storage.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"My dad received this as a gift. He loves photography and this made him think he was getting a new lens. Excellent work maKing a replica! Good deal, good seal, nice cosmetics and texture."
Beauty_5,4,OR,"It blends in your skin, very light and the smell is beautiful,"
Beauty_5,5,OR,Best brown lip liner ever. It’s so smooth and creamy.
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"My 2.5 year old daughter has been showing a lot of interest in doll houses lately so I bought this to give to her for Christmas. I chose this one firstly because we love Playmobil and have several products by them that are just great! Also comparable doll houses are more expensive and come with NOTHING! This doll house comes with so many pieces its crazy! The whole thing doubles as storage and locks up with a latch. The rooms are small and might pose difficulty manovering the people, but I also don't think my kid is going to mind.  I decided to open it up and assemble it before wrapping it for Christmas. Some assembly is required and is very easy. It come with a visual diagram on how to put some pieces together. I had a lot of fun looking at every thing and cant wait for her to play with it!

It comes with;

I think this doll house was well worth the money and can not wait to play with it with my daughter!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I'm a 75 year old and assembled this product myself. I sat down, placed all the pieces on the floor, in order and simply followed the directions. I used a hammer covered with a sock and it worked just like a rubber mallet. I didn't want to make holes in my bathroom wall, so this product works perfectly for me. It looks modern and matches with all the bronze accessories in my guest bathroom and have gotten compliments from guests already. Thanks Amazon. I always find what I need at Amazon. Packaging and delivery were great too."
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,Seems to be helping my 15 yr old Pom's kidney values manageable.  My homeopathic vet likes better than Denamarin or Sam E.
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Reed is a bear shifter totally opposed to getting close to a witch.  Other shifters might  choose to bond with witches but no way was he making that mistake.  Monica was just as adamant that witches and shifters had no business bonding together.  Her best friend can nag her all she wants but Monica wasn't going down that path.  No way!  Naturally, fate has a sense of humor and brings these two co-workers together one day at the office.  Neither is aware that the other is anything more than human.  Anticipation is delicious!  I held my breath waiting for the moment when Truth dawned on them.  After the reality ""hit the fan"", so to speak, then the story takes off at breakneck speed as they struggle with their feelings and who knew that a fight with a demon could clear the air so well.  Falling for the Bear is well written, beautiful and delightful.  I was given an ARC in exchange for an honest review.  Five stars."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Love everything about these protectors. They are cushy enough to keep my bakeware separated but I can still stack them. I use them in all shapes of glass bakeware, also as pot and pan deviders"
Electronics_5,5,OR,I just had to hide those showing wire and hide them from my sight and now I do not notice them at all in plain view.
Books_5,4,OR,"Held interest, good plot. Slang was a bit hard to follow."
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"When I read third and final book in this series, I almost cried!
Then I read the book. I'm still disappointed it's over.  But I love this series!!

Blake made it home to S-Island in book 2 #Fight. Alexis and Zach were together and things
were odd.
But Alexis proposed a solution; they just be together. Black, Zach, and Alexis.
Could the men do it? Could Alexis?

Before anything can happen, crazy Claire decided she was tired of Alexis getting in her way and tries to take her out. In the process both women find their way to a biker camp.
Women are traded for goods. Alexis is kept with the KingPin who is useless.
She comes up with a plan to rescue herself and any other women willing to escape with her.
Blake and Zach are planning too. They need to get their girl back.
Can they do it before she is killed or hurt?

This is another fast paced book, that keeps you on your toes and thinking.
What's going to happen? Can this work?"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"This is a nice little pot for boiling water.  It holds almost a quart which surprised me since it looks smaller.  I have yet to take it on a hike but I expect it will work well as it is light and strong.

The major flaw in the design is that it won't hold the little fuel canister because the hole for the lid is too small.  My hope had  been that I could put the little etekcity stove and a fuel canister in there.  If OuterEQ had opened up the lid just an 1/4"" more it would have taken the fuel canister and probably the stove.  Oh well.  I'm otherwise happy with it and I'll stuff something else in there."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,Fun toy for that spider-man fan.  No distortion when in use.  Item arrived in a few short days - I am very pleased.
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"For the price, this hutch is excellent. Not super-sturdy, but I'm not gonna be tossing it on the back of a truck and driving across the country....so.. yeah, it's a great indoor home for my little tortoise this winter!"
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I liked the characters because they seem like every day people you know. To have a terrible event happen is shocking. But I liked how Julia carried on, yet stayed true to herself. This seems like a good series to follow."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1,OR,Good quality wire but two times I ordered plastic device broke and all the wire was a mess!!!!!!!
Beauty_5,5,OR,"This shade is similar to Maybelline super stay matte ink in the shade lover"" but, is brighter and deeper shade. pink mauve but a vibrant version. Long staying, non-drying formula, stays on till you remove it but, I felt it to be a bit sticky but, does not feel uncomfortable. Will definitely suit fair skin tones. Thank you Nykaa and L'Oréal."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3,OR,"These are not the greatest deadlifting socks. They're a little on the thin side for deadlifts. The huge benefit is that i do look like Flash Gordon, even though me shins are dripping with blood. It is better to look good than to feel good."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Clients love these sheets. They feel ""high end"". Holding up well with frequent washing. No staining. Buy these if you like to spoil your clients!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,I use it for my small window fan. The sound is not exactly quiet and I wish there was a switch off/on. You need to pull it out from the socket to start/stop.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"If you're not afraid of showing some 'leg',  this is a great, minimal, running short.  Lightweight and comfortable.  Just what I was looking for."
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"My 1 year old baby loves it,it is a little bit short as many reviews has said but still interesting"
Books_5,5,OR,"This Oxford Classics edition has much to recommend it. First, it is translated into smooth modern English, which, while not conveying every subtlety of Greek, will nontheless help the present-day reader through this long work. Second, the price is under $10. Third, there is an excellent map collection at the back showing the ancient world as we see it and as Herodotus saw it. The notes, bibliography, appendices, indexes, timeline and glossary all make this a great resource for the student or casual reader. There is enough mention of content in all the other reviews. I just wanted to point out the advantages of this edition."
Beauty_5,4,OR,"Best for the pustule type pimples which are easy to pop. Not only does it extract the gunk, but it also keeps you from the temptation of bursting it, if you're into that. Shows no effect on cystic acne, and reduces the size of the regular pimples a little bit and it lays a little more flat."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"Have you ever tied a rubber band on your racquet as a string vibration dampener?
These dampeners are just adorable, and a fun change from the boring big name dampeners, and a far cry from using a rubber band.

One or two is all it takes, and they are fun to change out to personalize your equipment.

Sunshine, a flower, and three smiley faces that look like your favorite emoticons.

Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,PRECIOUS!  Well made and great price.  My daughter loved it!
Pet_Supplies_5,1,OR,"Uncomfortable for my dog, he chewed it off while he was in his crate and he has never done anything like that before!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"This chair is comfortable and sturdy when assembled and I am happy with the purchase.  HOWEVER, be advised that assembly was difficult.  I timed it, and it took me 2 hours to put this together and it required two people...the reason for that being that instead of the screws coming loose in a plastic bag like you would expect, this chair has the screws actually screwed in place on the unassembled pieces. I've never seen this before, but it's vexing.  So when putting this chair together, I had to first unscrew the screws that were VERY tightly held in place before I could put the arms on the chair and then rescrew the screws.

The bulk of assembly time was spent on unscrewing the screws -- it felt like an Olympic bodybuilder or a cyborg had tightened these things.  I ended up having to use a flathead screw driver and a wrench to get the screws off (I affixed the wrench to the screwdriver handle to give myself some extra torque and it was the only way I was able to get the screws off).

After that, I required a second person to hold the pieces together as I rescrewed everything together.

You need a lot of patience to be able to take these screws off, folks.  If you are not a patient person, then you should probably look for a chair that has the screws come loose in a plastic bag (the way Ikea does).

I think the price on this chair is great.  The leather is beautiful and so comfortable.  I'm actually sitting in the chair right now and it's giving me great back support.

I would rank this 5 stars if not for the fact it came with all the screws very tightly affixed and all the frustration that caused me.  I bought this chair for $80 but similar ones I saw at Target and other stores were around $125 or so --- so I feel like even with the frustration it was a great value."
Beauty_5,3,OR,"Its a very normal concealer, over priced. Expected much, not satisfied"
Books_5,5,OR,Great book about the end of WWII in the Pacific and the dropping of the atomic bomb and the decision leading to that.
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Every review I've read has been quasi-negative but not being one to listen to critics, I took a chance.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  Depending on why you go to a movie, you may not like this because it is not escapism.  It deals with real life issues and things most of us can relate to.  I found the movie to be very refreshing and all the characters real to life.  The main character is a single mom trying to raise a precocious son.  She has to deal with a dead-end relationship and an aging father, an irresponsible sister and a job she hates.  How she copes and what she does is more believable than most of the ""chick flick"" films out today.  I think this is one of the better movies in a sea of fluff to spend time and money on.  Amy Adams is wonderful and it is always refreshing to see Alan Arkin.  Please don't dismiss this film because of iffy reviews.  It is worth going to see."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Wonderful product.  Shipped promptly.  Ordered about ten sets a gifts.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I use to have a Big Blue filter, and struggled changing filters every few months.  Then I had one crack on me. Fortunally I was home.  I bought this to replace it.  I love the ease of changing filters and the peace of mind that it is a metal housing."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"My order for the Gosund T8 LED Emergency Nightlight Flashlight of 3-in-1 Function For Hands-free arrived in the mail quickly and timely thanks to Amazon Prime which is well worth the money if you order regularly from Amazon especially for the added free benefits of Amazon music and Amazon Video in addition to the free 2-Day Prime shipping.

First Impressions-- Looks good out the box.  Feels solid and has good quality construction feel.  Seems like a good high quality product.

Closer Inspection and usage-  Great multi function emergency light.  This thing is awesome and has some many uses.  It uses 3 AAA batteries which are not included.  3 modes of operation -- normal flashlight, flashing side lights and a red strobe light which can be used as a emergency flare.  Not too big and fits great in the hand.  Good device to function as a simple flashlight or an emergency safety device when needed.

PROS:
---Excellent, excellent Price (well worth the money)
---Good solid quality construction body
---Bright and easy to see
---3 modes
---Hands - free operation
---Can be used as an emergency roadside flare

Overall, if you are looking for a good quality, emergency flashlight, road flare, you can't go wrong with this from Gosund."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"small. but worked nicely. No directions, but I pulled them up from the site on Amazon.(Didn't need them). Took a couple of minutes to figure out,. I put $ in it for great-grandsons' birthday. Bought another for s grandson's birthday. Fun way to give a small gift."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"The attraction between Bradley and Mia was hot.  It was amazing how Mia tried to fight the attraction towards Bradley, but it could not be denied. As time went on, the two became involved and fell in love.  Good story."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"Very comfortable bra! Super soft fabric feels like I'm not wearing a bra at all...great support..no digging underwire, no slipping straps.
There's nothing worse than an ill fitting bra and i am extremely happy with these."
Electronics_5,5,OR,One of those things bought mostly because it LOOKS useful. Seldom use it but when I do it's as close to perfect as you can get for what it's made for.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"I'm 5'1 and 112lbs, barely a C cup and i got the XL and it fits like a regular Medium tshirt.. i did my best to read all the reviews and make sure i order extra large even though i'm smaller... i love it!! the material is not so great, i'm hoping with a wash it'll soften it up but not the best material. Length wise and color, i love!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,Im a lifter and I keep a chalk ball in my bag. I use this religiously when I deadlift. Great for keeping my chalk. I also get compliments on it all the time.
Electronics_5,4,OR,"FEELS fabulous. Down marks for the metal case making the key clicks resonate and ring too much, and that the 10-key pad is IBM standard (with double size plus key) and NOT Mac standard, which is crucial for working in ProTools."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I'm an owner of a recording facility and I've been creating music and commercials for the public, for 26 years now. Most people never see the cables that we use, so let me give you the idea.

For instance I have about a dozen 8 channel snakes with the  inch ends that are interconnects to and from the console to rack mount effects and processors and or the in and outs of 16 channel sound cards. The cables used within these snakes are as small as can be used for convenience. They have molded plastic ends with strain relief and they are bundled into a flexible tube with about 18 inches of free cables at both ends.

There's another version that's a 16 + 2 channel snake into a room for live drums that allows for low Z microphones to be plugged into it, there's 18 tiny, thin cables within this snake. That one is 50 feet long.

When people are impressed by large diameter cables, I know that they haven't been educated in what's needed, that they've been educated by advertising.

This is a great cable that has what's needed. I tested it's shielding by listening with cranked up headphones and running it over sources of EMF and heard nothing. It's soft and flexible making it tangle resistant and it has strain relief. The fact that it's thin is convenient, it does not reduce the performance one bit.

So the picture may show what appears to be another cheap cable, but this one is a couple grades better than those. It will feel different, it's smaller and easier to work with and I'll bet that it's interference rejection ratio is higher too.

Really, if you want 5 feet of Tip-Ring-Sleeve stereo, line level cable for any use, this cable is very close to perfect and I recommend it. I'm using it in my recording facility when needed without issue.

Thanks for sending me this nice cable to test and review."
Beauty_5,1,OR,"It damaged my hair like anything and hairfall,oh my god,that just happened so much,my hair were just falling like the leaves fall from trees in patjhar times.Even without touching them and sitting idle,they just fell off."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"The print is good, don't care much for the feel of the fabric. Not a big deal, it's more of a once a month scrub anyway. Lots of compliments and comments on it."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Incredible set at an unbeatable price, this is a ""must-have"" for fans of cinema in general, and fans of great science fiction in particular. Amazing picture quality across the board, it's hard to believe I saw this in the theater for the first time over 25 years ago. WB has set the bar for a premium quality box set release, and it was worth the wait."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"I looked high and low for a purple 'Soft Kitty' t-shirt. Thank you Amazon for having one!  The fabric is light for the summers, I work outdoors and this item is not too hot when worn in the humid southern heat.  Fits exactly as I expected. Priced right, delivered on time as promised."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"This anime was recomended to me and , so I gave it a try and automatically got hooked , its sad and funny with very memorable character . Now and the you remember their dolls that talk and move and your reminded creepy lol . Great anime and great Collection too it includes the OVA as well ."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Amazingly comfortable, great sound as well. One of the most well built headphones I have used, even better quality than my 200$ AKG K7XX's, You can wear these things for hours without even noticing you have them on!"
Books_5,5,OR,"Nothing can truly be written in a review of ""Tuesdays With Morrie"" that will do justice to the man on which the story was based. Morrie, a professor at a small college, has been diagnosed with a terminal illness. Rather than let it push him into depression and darkness he embraces his fate and uses it to teach life lessons to his favorite pupil of decades past (Mitch Albom, the author).
Every Tuesday Mitch drives or flies to see Morrie, and every Tuesday he walks away a better man for the experience. Though his body withers away, Morrie never truly dies because his life lives on in the people he touches.
It's a truly moving story, and you'll be glad you took the time to read it."
Electronics_5,4,OR,"Nice laptop for a very reasonable amount of money, it came in pristine condition, the only complaint is that some of the description is not correct but if your are willing to put up with little thinks missing here and there it is a perfect laptop"
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"I love this collection, it has several westerns that I had planned to purchase in one of my future orders, getting them all in collection of movies just made my day."
Books_5,3,OR,I respect how he grew up and what he has accomplished but I couldn't Get through the book .
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"I didn't see size options when I ordered, so the one i received was too large but seemed to get the job done. The zipper can snag a little but otherwise no complaints."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"This rack expands out to twice it's length, and you can fit shoes underneath it - so it ends up holding GOBS of shoes.  Great for a front hallway.  When extended out to it's max, it's easily 4.5-5 feet long.  Easy to put together and a total front hall saver!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,I'm very happy with this light! I used it to replace out old and outdated porch light. It was very easy to install and it works great! We set it up with a smart bulb so we can use Alexa to turn it off and on.
Books_5,5,OR,"Given that fifteen of the sixteen previous customer reviews have contained cogent and quite articulate praise for Professor Fussell's book, my praises may seem redundant.  However, this is such a brilliant and important book that I am compelled to write about it.
  I have been obsessed with The GW&MM since I first read it in 1978, so obsessed that I have read it many times.  Each time I read it new ideas and new authors spring out of the text and send me to the library or bookstore.  Fussell's prose is captivating, and his scholarship is breathtaking in both breadth and depth.  My first reading of The GS&MM was in Belgium during a Sabbatical year in Brussels.  Our son was writing a senior ISP on the effect of the German invasion on Belgium, and we went to Ypres as part of the research.  We were both overwhelmed by the 105 Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries there, and reading The GW&MM during that period helped to put these beautiful and touching burial grounds into the context of the mud and stink that was the Salient during (and for several years after) 1914-1918.
  Prof. Fussell introduced me to Graves (my favorite) and Sassoon and Blunden and David Jones and Wifred Owen and opened the door to these wonderful novelists and poets for a biochemist without much appreciation of British literature.
  The GW&MM presents an amazing constellation of knowledge and understanding and compassion for the victims of WW I, and my recommendation of this masterpiece is totally enthusiastic and without reservation."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"These are great! Super cute. I was always forgetting to not screw the corkscrew all the way into the cork so it didn't have a hole all the way through it. Now I don't have to worry about it. You can see the size of them from my pictures. Also, picture 4 shows me tipping the wine (and there really is wine in that bottle) and nothing drips out, so it definitely works!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Finally gave in and bought it. Takes all the guess work out. Just remember to store it dialed to lowest torque setting so you don't mess with the spring tension.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,I bought this to replace the carbon monoxide detector in the RV. I looked up the model I had and didn't want to pay over $70 for it so I researched alternatives and this model came up in the RV forums to purchase. It is smaller than what we had in size but I like the smaller size better. It came with the battery already installed so I had to do was pull the protective plastic strip and it worked right away. I did press the test button and everything seems to be working great. I will be using this as my replacement from now on. I am glad Amazon carries them at a good price.
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"Update August 8, 2012:

We've had this product for about a year now, and I'm still really happy with it.  It's definitely full from my dog, but we have not had any overflow issues.  I'm just about out of the powder that comes with the unit, so I'll need to get some more.  Otherwise, it's been a really convenient product to have.

I would suggest that you seriously dig the depth hole that they recommend in the instructions.  The deeper the better though as sometimes the dog poop will fall down in the hole when you flush the unit with water.

Original Post:

In all honesty, I was a bit pessimistic when I first got this thing a few months ago, but I was desperate enough to buy it.  Thankfully I did, as it's been a great addition to our household and in keeping out yard (and garbage) clean.

The unit is real easy to install.  Just dig a hole, shove it in, fill it up with water and the enzyme they give you, and you're off.  I am lazy with the unit, and normally just pick up our dogs (we just have one) poop on the weekend, and then every month flush the unit with 5-gallons of water and add more enzyme.  The thing seems to really be working.  We have dog play dates regularly, and the unit seems to be able to handle it.  Also, we're currently reaching 20 degree nights and 40 degree day here in Seattle, and it seems to still be working.

While this thing holds a lot of poop, I'm pleasantly surprised that there is not a horrible stench (sure it has a slight poo smell, but it's not gagging).  Definitely would recommend this unit to others who want to dispose of their dogs waste in their backyard."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"I love these books by Cynthia Wright! When I first looked at this series I thought that Natayla was Alec's sister (From Caroline) it was such a wonderful surprise to find that it was his daughter. I thought that it was a great way to carry one the family line.  I was sad to know that this was the last book in this series. I love the way that Natalya knows her own mind and has no problem stating that. The interaction between the different characters is smooth and flowing. It was great to revisit characters from other stories and see how that progress. As a history teacher I find historical detail accurate and impressive. I feel that she manages to capture how people actually acted in that time accurately. The author does not shy away from writing about the hardships that people dealt with during that time, which is refreshing to see. I do hope that she continues to write about these families!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"Read instructions, test, and forget it.
I have these units AND the fire / C M combo detectors both.
This stuff is deadly odorless and silent.
Do not let you home be without IF you have gas heat."
Beauty_5,5,OR,"Just blindly go for it. rosy dew🤩suits fair - medium ,and dusky skintone tooo."
Beauty_5,1,OR,Doesn't remove my nail paint I wouldn't prefer to buy this
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Been using this motherboard for months now, without any problems."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"I think Seinfeld rates on most peoples lists as one of the greatest comedies of all time. I rank Seinfeld in my top 5. I was holding off buying this set as it was insanely expensive for a very long time, but with the deal amazon had I just had to have it. I have not been disappointed one bit. The extras including the dvd and the coffee table book are all excellent. If your a Seinfeld fan and do not own this then you really are not a true fan."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,Bought as gift. My nephew loved it. Very durable lasted a very long time
Kindle_Store_5,3,OR,"I liked the plot of the book, but I'm very confused by the ending. It seems as if it's not a standalone book, but that the second is from her friends point of view, but about Stephanie and Denny's relationship. To each their own style, but I find series better if they are all in one point of view, or if they have a happy ending and then move on to other characters stories. I just feel like it's left hanging.

I feel like the dialogue was forced. Some of the things the characters said had me confused. I feel like in some places info was just to be assumed by the reader and not explained. I felt like it jumped around in some places and then in other things were dragged out. Things happened without explaining and I had to reread chapters thinking I missed something.

All in all, it wasn't bad. I love books with babies, I just feel as if I'm left hanging and have no way to fix it."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"Excellent, you retain your mobility while carrying essential gear

Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,Seriously worth watching.  I can't believe she actually has all those voices in her.  Amazing.
Electronics_5,1,OR,"It is a fake arduino, it works but is not genuine..

Also, the reset button don't works, I had to use the one in a modular board I connected on top of if"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"Nice piece but too short for my purpose, cheap enough that I'll just keep it to have a spare or trading material."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,very good quality and you can put it in dryer without it shrinking. fits beautifully and is great to wear with leggings.
Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,Not to be taken seriously.  This is a spoof and a lot of fun to watch.  I really enjoyed it in all it's cheesiness.  It ws just fun.
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,These movies are great and hold ones attention showing the greatness of Kojak and how he works.
Electronics_5,2,OR,I consider myself more then just a novice when in comes to the ins and outs of installing hardware and software.  But this one has so far managed to elude me.  I have an Asus P6T v1 and needed the SATA III along with the RAID capability.  I might note that my MB has two onboard RAUD controllers one of which is in use.  After about 26hrs straight of messing around with this thing I am positive there is some setting that I can't find or change that allows me to have both the RAID card and the onboard RIAD running at the same time.  I was able to get the RAID card to install and even managed a RAID0 config with windows installed.  But for some reason I am no longer able to get back into that windows config.  So I am trying my hardest to see a point in keeping this harware.  Tech support at High Point seem to be unable to give me an answer as to what settings I should be shooting for in both of the BIOS for the MOBO and the card.  Bottom line is relly unless you have a ton of time and a load of asprin I wouldn't suggest going for this card... I'll update if I manage to find some kind of solution but as it is it is far from plug and play.
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,The Stella doll diaper bag is precious. It is very well made and a perfect size for a toddler.
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,Great love story. Wonderful how a bad thing turn awesome. This is a great series and it was hard to put down. Could not wait to see the outcome. This is my favorite author.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,Fits great very comfortable and easy to use. So much better than the last one I had. I love it its easy to put on easy to adjust and works well even for me and I am a very large chested women.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I purchased this impact bit set by DeWalt relatively recently, but so far so good. Product quality seems to be very good, they hold up to my use (Carpenter) no problem. The assortment of bits includes everything I use regularly with my impact. Putting the bits away could be easier, the lay flat orientation can make it a bit of a pain ( especially with cold fingers). If my opinion changes down the road I will certainly update this review.

So far I wouldn't hesitate to recomend this product."
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"I brought this and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mega-Bloks-Lil-Pink-Bus/dp/B0033PRTX0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mega Bloks Lil' Pink Bus</a>&nbsp;for my 1 year old for Christmas because she liked playing with the Legos but always was putting them in her mouth. She always wants to play with them. When you don't let her she is pretty upset lol! I would give it 5 stars but the bag broke as soon as I unzipped it to let her play with them on Christmas. I had to replace it with another bag to put them in. It was a pretty bag too. I would definitely recommend these for a young child. They cant really swallow them and you won't be scared letting them put it in their mouths because the blocks are huge."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"I have given my keys to SO many people strictly because the following statement: ""Hey man, you got a bottle opener?"" Yes, of course I do."
Movies_and_TV_5,3,OR,"This movie is pretty wacky, but a lot of fun.  It's definitely worth the Amazon rental price.  Adults only, please."
Movies_and_TV_5,3,OR,"It goes with the soundtrack CD I purchased. Didn't care for it and probably won't ever watch it again. Predictable, not a great transfer to DVD. Tried to enjoy it, surprised Anthony Quinn took the part."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,Much larger than expected. Almost excessive but I love the patterns and it looks wonderful in my room.
Beauty_5,5,OR,"Dark black, smudge proof, long-lasting and easy to use with this tip liner. Love the brand."
Books_5,4,OR,"As always, Grisham delivers very captivating story line. Rather than last me for a while as an ""occasional"" read, I blew through this one in just a few short days.  Character development is spot-on, and the depth of information about the challenges faced by Appalachian Miners is very revealing.  I was left somewhat disappointed by the fact that the author didn't take the story further and wrap-up more of the storyline.  I was also disappointed as I expected some follow-up editorial information/direction regarding the plight of the miners. Was it fully fact-based, an entertaining, yet trumped-up piece of fiction, or something else entirely?"
Pet_Supplies_5,1,OR,"this seemed like one of the more higher end dog food since it cost twice as much as the dog food I got the first time I got my shelter dog.. She's a terrier mix (my vet tells me terriers are picky with food? I'm not entirely sure being a first-time dog owner), so I'm trying out different dog food that she'll like.. I saw great rating on this dog food, so I tried giving it a go, but she barely eats any! She'll only eat about a quarter of a cup an entire day, and start eating the grass outside when I take her out... I fed her the indoor mini dog royal canin stuff before, and that one smelled much nicer like a can of tuna (which made her poop smell nicer) and she actually ate her portions when I gave that to her. I was just hoping if I was going to spend that much money on dog food, I might as well find her the best one for her, but this one is a total miss.

I might give another brand besides royal canin a try (since it's so expensive...), but I'm going to stay away from the taste of the wild..."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"ok ever since this whole walking dead phenomenon started my hubby has been on this survival gear kick for ""just in case"". I usually laugh at it, but it got me thinking, I have been in situations living around the world where I was stuck in the worlds worse typhoons and was without for a long time. It would have been nice to have some of this survival gear. And that made me think I do live in a area where natural disasters happen, you never know and you do want to be prepared. So when I came across these emergency thermal blankets, I thought perfect, it will go great in my emergency kits for the cars and the house. It comes in a pack of 10, which is so nice, because I have them in my emergency kit in the cars and the house. Each blanket comes individually wrapped in it's own ziploc type bag for easy storage. The bag is about 4 3/4"" x 3"" in size. Fully opened, the blanket measure approximately 81 1/4"" long x 51 1/2"" wide. These blankets are said to reserve/reflect about 90% of your body heat. They are also waterproof and weather proof. Hopefully I will never have to use them in an emergency, but it puts my mind at ease knowing I have them and that they work really well!!  I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I'm offering up to you to read, my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad. My opinions are my own and I was not paid or compensated in any other ways. I completely recommend everyone have these."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"I like these and not sure if they would fit a half size smaller so I kept them.  They seem a bit long in the front, but are very comfortable and look cute with jeans, and leggings.  Love the color."
Beauty_5,5,OR,"Good product, easy to smudge which helps in getting the perfect smokey eye makeup"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"Using 1/3 cup to feed my Chihuahuas and the rest to help me with portion control.  Overall, great items for the price."
Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"I was shipped the UK version (live in US and ordered i US).  When I tried to redeem the Ultraviolet code, I was given an error message that the code will not work in the US.  How dissappointing as I only bought this movie for two reasons: 1) to stream while away from home and 2) To watch in 3D at home.  Now I am concerned that this UK version will not play on my US 3D Bluray player.  Beware buying this version.

UPDATE - a user posted in the comments of this review a method to redeem UK Ultraviolet codes on a US account.  It worked, so I now have my digital copy also.  I also tried the disc on my 3D Blu-ray player and it does work.  I have what I wanted so I am now satisfied."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"The water gets HOT on the AZ sun! Too hot during the summer months. But all you have to do is run it a little to cool off. Turning the water off while not rinsing, our whole family of 4 could shower with hot water! We love it."
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,It's a nice comfy bed. The height seems ok. I wish it was a little bigger. My 8lb pooch barely fits in there. Probably will be great toy dogs or cats.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3,OR,Very nice but you have to be careful in handling. The edges crack easily.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,I had a 3 piece blue set of this luggage and on a trip recent trip the largest piece was damaged. When the airline replaced my bag they sent black. I ordered a carry on size and gave my husband the black set and replaced my large blue piece. If my hardside luggage is damaged again I won't be replacing it with the same brand.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I live in California and earth quakes can be a bit of a problem so having water in a bag is pretty good for an emergency. I keep some in my bug out bag, and in my car. I have never tasted the water inside so I can't say how it tastes, but in an emergency who cares how it tastes?"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4,OR,"Cute shoes! for the price is worth getting. I do not have narrow feet and the size I ordered fit me well. I always got half a size up. Long wear, depending on the activity, the shoe is comfortable."
Toys_and_Games_5,1,OR,Bought this last Christmas for my kids. My kids had a blast playing with it but it only lasted a few months.  Too bad.  It just stopped working.  When I went in to change the batteries they were eroded.  scary.
Electronics_5,3,OR,"I got this as a Christmas gift for my wife after one of the grandkids broke the screen on her last one.  Not very pleased with the quality of the cameras or the screen resolution but it does what she wants it to do. The colors are great it's just a little grainy if your looking at pictures or watching a video and the pictures from the camera are very grainy.  This was a disappointment to her because she likes to take it when we go hiking and use it for pictures.  This one won't work well for that due to poor camera quality. I wanted to get the same one she had but couldn't find it on amazon.  Maybe they don't sell it anymore.  The tagital seems to respond fast enough for browsing the net and playing her games.  The touch screen is sensitive enough.  We only had one issue after a few hours.  It worked great with the included keyboard at first then last night it wouldn't boot up, kept getting an error message.  Then we unplugged the keyboard and it booted correctly.  Haven't tried the keyboard again to see if it was a fluke or the keyboard actually went bad.  The included case is very nice and I like the way the tablet actually is snapped in place.  Much more secure than the one she had with her other tablet.  For the price I paid we are not overly disappointed.  In short if you want to just browse or play games buy it.  If you want to take pictures and watch videos I'd look else where.  This is the first thing I've purchase through Amazon that I wasn't 100% happy with."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,I got it for emergencies and camping.  I'm very satisfied as it appears to have a decent weight and should be quite versatile.  I was sent the red which is more of a brick color.  No complaints on this one.
Beauty_5,4,OR,"I used the highlighter gives superb result, looking different look"
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,These are identical to pads I've been using under another name that cost 20% more from a retail store for 100 units. Excellent product for a small indoor dog. My guy can use the 24x24 size 3-4 times for pees before changing as there is no odor and plenty of room if he needs to do his little dance for #2 first thing in the morning.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"Some of them the adhesive peels off with the backing.  then they are useless. If all the adhesive stuck on it, I would give them a five."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I love to make custard in the cold months, and this is a nice matched set that work very well."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,"I bought a  couple of the duvet covers and they are so nice,  silky  and soft."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,The pan is just the right size to hold 4 pieces of bread when making French Toast.  The no stick feature is great making clean up a snap.  The aluminum body is rigid and does *not* warp or twist while cooking.  I highly recommend it.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3,OR,"I have a love hate with these, They don't last as long as they used too. But i haven't found a better replacement yet."
Electronics_5,3,OR,"I feel like it should be a 2.5 star rating.

Pro's:
It's a great little keyboard for the tablet.
The cover was pretty good, solid.

Cons:
The material falls apart easily. I barely had it a week and the magnetic piece material that keeps it closed was coming off and after a few more days fell off.
Didn't fit my tablet very well.

I liked it as a cover - but it fell apart way to soon."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,dont know exactly how these are suppose to fit but I don't like them. You can feel the ends under the balls of your feet
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"Worked great on our first campout - there was light rain, and the bottom of our tent stayed dry.  Seems durable, the campsite had rocks everywhere and the groundsheet didn't rip or tear."
Beauty_5,5,OR,Very luxurious....in affordable range makes your base matt...and flawless...without dry or patchyness...so smooth in application....just loved it....
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,My son likes this but because it folds in half the tent style doesn't stay upright for long. Keeps collapsing.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Cleans brushes well.  Can't ask for more from mineral spirits.
Electronics_5,5,OR,Fast shipping. Screen protector came with an installation kit. Easy to put on device.
Books_5,5,OR,"This is a book that you will want to re-read.  It is complex and ambiguous, so it takes time to ponder over clues and come up with theories as to what exactly happened and what it means.

I will say that the first novella in the book is a very strong, intriguing start.  The second novella describes an alien society.  It is probably a bit perplexing on the first read through, but it is still an entertaining read and you will at least get the overall picture.

I'd recommend this book to any serious science fiction reader, or any serious reader who likes science fiction occasionally.  If you don't like science fiction, you might have a knee jerk reaction to the book just because of its genre.

I would recommend Wolfe's ""the book of the new sun"" first, but this is still a great work that merits a 5 by itself."
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"The book was an exhilarating,love story. I enjoyed every word written. It is refreshing to read a great love story contemporary to today's ideals."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,Great crocks for dog crates. I suggest these for anyone who has a dog that knocks over bowls in crates.
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"Oh, unf. I have loved every word of The London Lovers. Silas and Molly were such a fantastic match and they flew off the page with Sierra Simone's talented and passionate mind.
Molly overcame so much and Silas' devotion is swoon worthy. Fortunately, he likes to take your breath away in other, more exciting, ways.
Silas is a package and a half. He keeps Molly (and us) on edge with his dirty talk and his tenderness. It's an enigma and I love hearing all the sexy details coming out of his mouth.
This conclusion provides resolution for Molly. Her character was so very strong and determined and justice was served through the help of her devoted friends and Silas. She is a champion and you can't help but wonder how many ""Mollys"" were broken because of the situation they were born into.
If you read the first London Lovers, you will read this one. You have to have loved both. Sierra Simone never disappoints and I can't wait for the next  journey."
Beauty_5,5,OR,"This is the first time that I got my hands on the brand 'Herbal Essences'. And it really exceeded my expectations. The bio renew formulation worked well on my hair & thoroughly cleansed my scalp, everytime I used. It's loaded with the concoction of potent aloe & eucalyptus which work wonders for dull & frizzy hair."
Pet_Supplies_5,4,OR,"The collar came quickly, and the cat doesn't mind wearing it.  It has a little bell on it, so now I know where she is.  The colors are very vibrant and the numbers are easy to read.

October 27 Update
A friend of mine liked the first one so much, she asked me to order one for her new kitten.  She loves it."
Books_5,5,OR,"This is a fascinating book and story that must be read all the way through book three in the series to be truly understood. Once I realized what it was truly about, it became much easier to wade through the diversions that are set up with too much going on about minute details and the thoughts of the characters.  More action would have pleased me but I guess I am just accustomed to the masters of those kinds of books.

One needs to remember that it was written so long ago that the prose is, to me, cumbersome and Lewis goes on and on about things philosophizing at great length about the smallest issue. I felt I had to stick with it in spite of this because by the time I began to see this, I had already invested too much time in the reading of it.

I enjoyed this last book in the series more than the first two."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Excellent light weight hand drill with lots of torque and good battery life.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I've never worn wireless earbuds before and I was a little concerned about how much they might way and just the overall comfort of them and then they arrived. These things are light and to be honest they are quite comfortable as well. I read several reviews stating that they would fall out of the persons ear so I was a little worried about that as well. I did not have that problem at all. They paired up to my phone easily and quickly and then I popped them in my ears and went to go walk down the street to get the mail. Fit fine and did not jar loose on the short walk. I then took them for a short 4.5mile run the next morning on a combination of sidewalks and dirt paths and the only time I had to readjust the earbud was when the wire that connects the two sides got pulled on by the collar of the shirt I was wearing. Other than that they stayed put and sounded great. I have not run out of battery on them and I have used them on and off for the past couple of days around the house and at the gym. The only thing I would change would actually just be adding an option for additional colors to choose from, but the bright yellow definitely makes them hard to misplace.

They sound great.
They stay put
They are light
I like them and I will be using them for all of my future runs and gym workouts.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review."
Beauty_5,5,OR,This color is to die for. very beautiful red with bluish undertone.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"5'6"" and 125. I have literally tried on about 30 pairs of jeans this year. Gap, Lucky Brand,Express,Saks, Macy's,seriously if they are known for their jeans have been there. Who is shaped that way.? A mid-rise jean is not 10 inches from your crotch to your waist? Legs so tight they all wound up inside out , crotch up on the dressing room floor! Sorry to the help but when the leg openings are so tight I am wrestling them off they can untangle the wretched things. The mid-rises hit half way up my back! I am 65 years old so white jeans are very tricky. These are perfect. I hate paying this much for a single pair of jeans but I am NOT sending these back as I expected to.. Good weight and still not see through? I thought they were going to be lightweight and they are but not too thin/thick. The rise is a perfect 8 inches/zipper 4 inches and the leg openings allow someone with a calf muscle to move  and they don't ride up. I've had them on about 3 hours now and yeah they stretch out a little but in a good way. I can sit cross legged on my bed w/o discomfort! But these jeans! I don't care what color just get a pair before these sell out. I may buy another color myself. I tried to get a shot of my ass in but it wouldn't download! If these make a 65 yr old old lady look good- you'll rock them!"
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"A cute little plush critter with a biiig mouth a happy grin, and a real Elmo voice (just like on Sesame Street)  -- this Gund Nursery Rhyme Elmo Sound Toy ...  is endearing and cute to look at --- as he sits there, book in hand, big grin on mouth. Flick the switch on his tusch, squeeze his left foot and Elmo reads you a Cute Little Poem, one of 5. ""Do you want Elmo to read you ANOTHER poem?"" he then says -- Well, It took us a while to realize that Shouting ""YES!!! "" was not the way to hear another poem (LOL) but SQUEEZING his left foot IS the way to entice him to recite them, one at a (foot squeeze) time. His diction is FLAWLESS. He also makes cute and pertinent comments about each poem, which is delightful to adult and child. Kids can recite the poem(s) with him. (if you don't want to hear another poem Elmo apologetically says ""OK Maybe Later, Bye Bye!""

The book he is holding has drawings on it that illustrate the poems -- ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"", ""Humpty Dumpty"", ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"". ""The Itsy Bitsy Spider"", and Hickory Dickory Dock"". All of this is CUUUTE. So is Nursery Rhyme Elmo. Cute, with floppy little fuzzy legs, but not totally cuddly as his inner workings and his mouth are made of Hard Stuff and he has a hard butt -- so, carrying him around would be fun for a kid, but I doubt close-cuddling would be very enticing.

However, this is a cuuute toy and each poem invites dialogue and the use of imagination between parent and kid or between siblings ."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2,OR,This looks like an okay shoe. I usually wear 990 womens 10. 5B or 10. 5D (whichever I can find in a bright color). These Leadville mens 8. 5D were too narrow across the ball of the foot.
Books_5,5,OR,"Once you start reading you can't stop...a very riveting series - this book was my favority, but read them all!"
Books_5,1,OR,"I have a kindle and read all the books in this series except for Demon Angel, which is not on kindle.  I love this series.  I found it clever, sexy and intelligent.  Except for the author's annoying habit of over using names in conversation, I felt they were very well written.  So I decided I would buy the paperback of Demon Angel and read how they all began.  I was bitterly disappointed.  While reading I got the sense that I was plodding around in a thick fog, going nowhere.  The behavior of both Lillith and Hugh made little sense and I am currently at page 188 and realize I am receiving no pleasure reading this book, and so I have given up.  If you have not begun this series, I strongly recommend you skip this book and begin with Demon Moon.  Ms. Brooks explains enough in future books that you won't miss out on anything having missed Demon Angel.  I'm hoping the reason this book is not available on kindle is because the author has plans to rewrite it into something worthy of the other excellent books in this series."
Beauty_5,5,OR,I don't have grey hairs but I use it to hide my bald spots and works for that.. but it has very less quantity of product in it
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,i followed the other reviews and they were right i normally fit in a large but i ordered a medium and it fits me very well i like this vest because it is very stylish but simple at the same time
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4,OR,"Good quality shin guards but I find myself having to adjust them frequently. no matter how tight the straps are, they want to slip to the side after kicks"
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,This is a classic movie for me.  My family and I watched this movie and reminisced about the old days.  This is a good wholesome movie to watch with the family.
Books_5,5,OR,"I could not put this book down.  Quick paced, intriguing and exciting.  If you liked Gone Girl, you will love this book!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1,OR,"I had a cute little apple timer like this in college, so I ordered this one as well. When it arrived I stuck it next to my oven. I tried baking a pizza the very next day, setting the timer as usual , but it didn't go off. It made the ticking sound but didn't ring when the time was up. Low and behold, another burnt pizza, because I was waiting for my timer to go off. So disappointing, because it was a really cute timer. I returned it."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"6 years later and my son's 'Blue Bear' still holds up. Superior crafting, high-quality manufacturing techniques, and what I assume has to be proprietary magick, and Blue Bear - and I assume all of his Gund cousins - hold up to years of daily use and abuse.

Our little bear has become a member of our family and endured every treasured indignity a childhood best friend can proffer.

If you have a loved one in your home who might be lonely or need a companion, you owe it to yourself to make this purchase. You won't regret it. The smiles will be an ongoing reward and though the giver or occasion may be forgotten in time... the new friend never will."
Electronics_5,5,OR,Bought 2 of these to mount TV's in our house to free up space. These were a great deal were really easy to set up came with a HDMI cable and a level that came in handy. I read some people had issues setting these up took me about an hour to fully mount 2 TV's they are so easy you don't even need the manual.
Electronics_5,5,OR,"THIS IS A GOOD REVIEW (all negativity ends to be a positive ending), I give it 5 stars!

I had a MAJOR lightning storm that killed about 5 of my electronics, including my desktops network card, which is built into the motherboard. When I found out it wasn't working, I went searching on Amazon for a new one (since Amazons merchandise is always on sale, or just plain cheap, money wise) and found this. I kept a tab on this open and looked at other, but my decision came back to this because of how cheap it was, and the good reviews, AND a similar story to mine someone else said (lightning storm, built into modem, etc. ) When I purchased it, I completely forgot about it until it arrived today. I soon hooked it up, excited and all. As soon as I power it on, I got that Limited but No Connectivity. I went through EVERYTHING trying to fix it, over an hour and a half. Nothing. I went out and came back and still nothing. So I looked up online problems that could relate to this. After about 3 websites, I came across a forum comment saying to download a tool called WinsockXPFix, after opening this small app and 'Fix'ing it, it worked. And now I'm sooooo happy, enough to get back on here, and write a review. I also found that little app just replaces missing files old programs I uninstalled, took with them. I wrote about this program for others who have any network problems relating to this Limited but No Connectivity issue."
Electronics_5,5,OR,"I bought one of these lenses used off of eBay. While it would be nice to have a higher maximum aperture than f4, this lens is ridiculously sharp, and having the full frame equivalent range of 24-105mm is really nice for a lens of the size of a typical kit lens."
Books_5,4,OR,Good book especially if you're interested in the early days of the Pacific War.
Books_5,3,OR,"The book is fine, but the DVD was not included, so the seller refunded me instead of sending the DVD. I had to go buy a DVD elsewhere."
Books_5,5,OR,"This book was eye opening for me...
I so enjoyed Ms. Hanna writing a richer story.

Beautiful and tragic
Wellness done"
Kindle_Store_5,4,OR,"I've had this one on my TBR list for a while and when it went on sale for 99 cents it was time to one click and read. The free sample was intriguing and it made me really curious as to what happened that separated this sexy biker from his little girl and her mom. Fighting to Stay is a book about a woman who always runs away from trouble or anything uncomfortable in her life and while I understand her reasoning, I don't agree with her immature thought processes.
Roam is that hot alpha male biker with a rough exterior but sweet softer side that he only shows to certain people. Lacey gets under his skin and their up and down relationship starts...and it blossoms into real love until some very devious plot twists and turns send her running away with his baby girl. I really liked this book even though it was a way more ""kindler, gentler"" version of a biker book than what I'm used to (more family and children around) and the sexual relationships were so steamy and heat inducing without being too sleazy (even a threesome!).
My biggest issue was the major skipping of time...chunks of elapsed time throughout the book was probably so the author could get farther faster and make this a complete standalone. BUT I also have an issue with books whose characters act without thinking things through and getting the ""WHOLE PICTURE"" before taking off. OMG...how many times did people not listen or not let someone finish a sentence before slamming the phone off and not finding out the truth before years pass!!
On the whole though, I enjoyed this book and would read more by this author as the story and characters were real and down to earth.

****4**** have my babies and live HEA stars =)"
Pet_Supplies_5,2,OR,"I broke down and bought this mat in a fit of desperation because I was sick and tired of the sheer amount of litter and waste my two 4-5 month old kittens were tracking everywhere BUT inside their litter box! At first it worked relatively well, though the indentations are pretty shallow and don't catch everything. But then my kittens took to picking at the mat, which caused the PVC to shred. So then in addition to the usual tracking of litter and waste, there were also little PVC particles everywhere! I am still finding it all over the house.

So for me, this mat did not work well. However, I do want to add the disclaimer that if you have older cats, or just cats who are not interested in picking at the PVC material, this mat might work better for you."
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,"Awesome probiotic! My shepherd has a sensitive stomach and this helps keep him regulated and if he ever gets into something he shouldn't, this helps him handle it."
Pet_Supplies_5,1,OR,"My 5 dogs and 3 puppies all would not eat this & the usually love everything!! My daughter' dog got sick when she mixed it 50/50

We raise Goldendoodles, and I had HIGH hopes that my puppies would love this as I've been researching high quality dog foods.... well it doesn't matter how high the quality is supposed to be if the puppies/dogs won't eat it! NONE of my 5 adult dogs or 12 puppies ages 2-8 month old puppies would eat it straight. I've been having to mix in meat drippings to get them to eat any of it and it caused SEVERE digestive upsets in ALL my dogs! Also when I bought mine (it was on sale) I told my daughter to try it for her dog & she had the same problem, she was mixing it 50/50 with his regular food and where he normally ate 1 bowl a day, his bowl sat for 3 days and still had kibble in it and he also had an upset stomach from the little he ate and she was up cleaning his ""accidents"" and this dog that had never had one, had several in the middle  of the night !! If this was any good (*& my dogs liked it) I was going to order 20 bags at the sale price of 2/3 off! But now I know why it was so heavily discounted. The dogs won't eat it and it makes them sick! My dogs are Goldendoodles that my son raises hers is a small Havanese that can dehydrate quickly so 3 days of  severe GI problems  trying to introduce a new food was about the limit for her. He is back on his normal food and his tummy is doing better! I DO NOT recommend this food even if it was FREE!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I used a few of these to replace the halogen tube type bulbs in a few ceiling light fixtures with standard LED bulbs.  My worry with halogen bulbs is has always been the intense heat they put out in a small space, like a light fixture.  By making a few simple modifications to the fixture, and installing one of these standard bulb sockets to replace the halogen bulb holder, I change a fixture from consuming 100 watts to consuming about 10 watts and eliminate a LOT of wasted and potentially dangerous heat in the fixture.

Easy to do if you're reasonably mechanically inclined and have some electrical knowledge....just be safe and make sure you know what you're doing.  First thing of course, turn the power off to the fixture!"
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"My son loves this, and it's very cute. Hasn't broken yet, though it's only been 2 months."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Works as advertised.  It's being used in an insulated storage shed that tends to get damp at times.  This thing gets the air flowing and is easy to use.
Pet_Supplies_5,5,OR,It's hard to tell from the picture but the mount is made of sturdy metal. They're very well made. I ordered multiple sizes and am very pleased with them all. Fast shipping too.
Beauty_5,4,OR,I am happy to buys this product. Size is a little bit small but overall it is good.
Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"I was always a fond of this film as a kid, part Island of Lost Souls, part sci-fi and part historical nonsense, Atlantis the Lost Continent is certainly entertaining and for those of us who remember it fondly, this DVD release will surely be a treat. The widescreen print looks very good and is in color. I mention this because when I was growing up in the 60's we had a black and white TV set and watching this DVD was the first time I saw this film in color!

Like other Warner releases there isn't any extras, but a trailer. The price is steep, but Warner does run specials, which can bring the price down between $12.00 and $14.00. If you want the film at a reasonable price, wait until they run a sale."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,Great product!  Works like a charm!  My granddaughter loves how the lights go with her music and likes going through all the colors.  Would definitely buy again!
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2,OR,"This swimsuit is adorable! However, I wore it once and won't be wearing it again. I purchased it for a beach vacation and got one days use out of it--however, the color bled and stained my skin underneath the suit. It also rubbed off on my (much more expensive) cover up, and the beach lounge chair I was sitting on.. Additionally, the top is very flimsy and offers no cup support at all. (Unlike how it appears in the picture.) For the price paid I didn't expect much and probably would have given it a higher star rating if it hadn't stained my skin, clothing, and beach chair!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,This has worked well for me.  It does exactly what it's advertised to do and seems well-constructed.  I've had mine for well over a year now and it's still going strong.  Used exclusively for taking hot soups to the office for lunch - I've never used it for coffee but expect that it would perform just as well for that purpose.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2,OR,"It's not well constructed.  I haven't used it to field dress a deer yet, but out of the package the knife seems sharp, but the blade wiggles greatly.  The blade wiggles so much that I'm afraid the lock may break and there goes my fingers.  I can't suggest this item.  There are better dressing knifes for just $5 more."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"i enjoyed this movie because it mentions what the planet is like and how the author creates the solutions to problems coming up,"
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,This ended up a present to my granddaughter from her new baby brother. She loves Barney & we pray she'll love Cal also. It was a big hit at the hospital & I am sure the nurses were glad to see her go home because Barneys singing can get to you after being played a 1000 times. Thank you for making my grandson a big hit with his Big Sister. P S they are 20 months apart in age.
Movies_and_TV_5,4,OR,"This is a strong production filled with beautiful and dramatic singing, and Wixell's playing a dual role tightens the story. Some artistic lapses in the directing are made up for by the exceptional final act."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,Great DVD set for a great story.  Just started rematching it!
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"They work fine now for 6 months, would give 5 stars but recipes are horrible."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Great pillow protector.  Well made and soft with no sound.  Have purchased these twice now and would purchase again!
Electronics_5,5,OR,"Does not have the ""soft"" feel of a leather case - but it is what it is.  Perfect fit - protects the kindle - and easy to handle.  Very sturdy and looks good."
Toys_and_Games_5,3,OR,They were cut from fake fur cloth and I was able to use several of them.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"While there are other pliers that will do the job, not many will perform as well as this set does."
Books_5,3,OR,"Mr. Barzun, has on page 739 attempted to define novels as opposed to tales. He is neither an editor, nor as near as I can determine, a writer of novels. Most of his information about ""detective tales"" seems to be based on books written in the 1920s. Do not mistake anything he says as being helpful in the writing of a modern novel. Novels, like clothing, come and go in fashion as to their form and content. You may write what he calls a ""tale"", i.e., the relating of adventures that take for granted motives and settings, but if you pursue that course, you will look long and hard for someone to buy it. The modern reader is interested in motivations, and wants your characters to explain themselves to him/her. Actions and dialog without the subtext is boring, and does nothing to illuminate the human condition for the reader."
Beauty_5,4,OR,"The highlighter is great i swear, no glitter chunks, and gives amazing shine. What i am little disappointed with is the contour, it's good but not very pigmented."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2,OR,"Construction is ok.  Another chinazon company with a half dozen brands of the identical helmet to spread bad rating around.  I rate it 3 stars because all the Velcro pieces that hold the liner in, needed to be glued properly as they came unstuck on the first removal for washing.  The only way to know if it actually meets any impact standards is to destroy it and I'm not made of money.  I just now knocked a star off because I just realize they don't even claim to meet any impact standards whatsoever."
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"Good movie! This movie is not for the ""Politically Correct"" or those who are easily Offended! I really don't see the problem as Django wins everything in the end! Hats off to Jaimee Fox and Samuel L."
Books_5,5,OR,I had never heard the story of the nurses left behind during the wars. A few of the nurses stories written with integrity and perspective that can only come from the passing of time.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I really like these. Rounded stick that isn't too heavy and is very easy to handle. Comes in two sleeve punches that are nice to have, too. Cleans easy in the dishwasher. Glad I bought them."
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,Very cute doll.  The animals respond clearing when facing necklace.  It seems to be well made.  I bought it for my 6 year old grand daughter.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5,OR,"I, too, have been a DeWalt user for many years, having moved to their brand when I felt the Makita line went substandard.  After deciding to move up to an 18 volt product, I spent months conducting research, going to wood shows, and actually trying out numerous lithium ion and non-litium ion 18 volt tools.  My final choice was this kit.  Here are some of the reasons why:

Batteries:  18 volt lithium ion.  Fantastic idea to go with lithium ion.  The charge lasts longer and will not dissipate over time.  In addition, the battery design (outer housing) is smart.  I do not need to click two buttons on the side to disengage the battery from any of the tools.  I simply need to click the one button on the front of the battery and the battery slides out.  Because my hands are small, this makes all the difference in the world.

Drill Driver - For my hands, this was the most ergonomically correct grip I found.  This drill feels great, does not fatigue my hands after many hours of use, and does not weigh as much as the competition.  The 18 volt battery does not add as much weight as I thought it would, and the tool balances in my hand perfectly.  In addition, I didn't think I would like having LED's built into the drill, but I really do like the additional light when I am working.  Excellent drill all around.

Recip Saw - Again, excellent feel and power.  I have used this saw to cut through a variety of materials without any lag.  The one button saw change also adds a nice touch.  Grip and balance are excellent, with the battery adding the perfect amount of counterweight to the entire setup.

As I mentioned earlier, I looked at all of the kits available.  For the price and the product you receive, I don't think you could find a better value for your money than this kit."
Beauty_5,5,OR,Good one intense colour but a bit hard to rub
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,Totally cool trick scooter. My 10 year old adores it and rides it almost every day! It's light but sturdy and does tricks like a breeze!
Electronics_5,5,OR,"This is an awesome radio! I have two and showed it to my friend and she ordered one to. Great sound, Great battery life, Charges my Ipod with ease, Lightweight... Over all this deserves 1000 stars in my book."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3,OR,Always get water in them compared with other glasses that don't get water at all. Maybe they are good for kids not for adults. I recommend you other glasses.
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,This was a Christmas gift to my 8 year old and he loves it.  We set it up Christmas day and then left for a few days.  When we came back one of the cars wouldn't operate as it did before we left.  We did some switched batteries and tried some minor problem solving but the car just wouldn't work correctly.  Contacted the company and received a prompt response back.  Did the steps as was recommended to us from Tech Support and then gave them the results.  They again responded promptly and advised that they would need to send out a calibration tool but with the holidays and such we wouldn't have it until after the 1st of the year.  No problems here.  Rec'd the calibration tool earlier than I expected and performed the steps that were supplied and everything works great!  Couldn't be happier with the support we rec'd.  ...and love this racetrack.  Would definitely recommend.
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,"I love this DVD! Rodney Yee DVD's from Gaiam have become some of my favorite practices. You really need to know a bit about yoga (like the warrior series) before you do this practice. There are no detailed instructions, so I think it would be disappointing for a beginner.

I loved the flow of this practice. Yes, the sun salutations are a bit fast, but is okay since this warms you up for the floor stretches to follow. He holds you in downward facing dog to rest, but I think the pace is perfect to warm you up quickly. It is a short workout of only 30 min., but perfect for those days when I don't have a lot of time. You will definitely get the flexibility on the floor postures after the warm up.

I use Rodney's ""Power Yoga Total Body"" which I love too, but it is 1 hour. This practice is very similar, but 1/2 the time. You really can't go wrong on this one for $7 on Amazon.

It is beautifully filmed in Joshua Tree which brings back memories for me of rock climbing in the 70's...

Please see my other review on Amazon of yoga and meditation dvds."
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,The package came in pretty fast. It took a little over 3 days to get here. Came packaged in a big box and only saw a minor dent in the corner but boxes tend to do that with a small drop or so. It was wrapping really nicely and you can see everything it comes with. I'm hesitating to open it or keep it in mint condition and buy another one I can actually open. Comes with the little Sylveon figure and 4 booster packs which I found pretty cool. Really loved it so much that I took a picture of it on my Instagram haha. Recommend his if you've wanted every single Eevee form and a couple more cards.
Beauty_5,5,OR,"It’s my second purchase, it’s really pretty transfer proof, amazing shade, must try"
Books_5,3,OR,"I greatly enjoyed the Decker/Lazarus early books at the beginning of the series.  They were character driven and shared the lives of the main characters, Peter Decker and Rina, as their relationship grew into marriage and family.  More literary in writing style and with characters you came to care about, you almost forgot the books were in the ""Mystery"" genre.  Admittedly, I hadn't read a number of the novels in the middle of the series, but jumped to ""Gun Games"".  Although the elements of the early Decker/Lazarus novels were there, it seemed more ""commercially"" than ""character"" driven.  The ""F"" word abounds and even when it might fit the character and situation; it is over used.  Other graphic sexual terms and situations are also included.  The book seemed a mixed up jumble of young teenaged romance and sex with a mystery thrown in involving more of the same.  That said, the main characters, the foster son of Decker and Rina, 15 year old, Gabe, and his 14 year old girlfriend, are characters you like and hope to see as adults moving on with their lives in a later book.  But a lot less of the sexual details and foul language would be nice!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5,OR,"The rack is strong and well made.  I had read some other reviews that expressed concern about the quality of the welding joints, but that was not the case in the front or rear racks that I purchased for my Surly Disc Long Haul trucker. Surly may have tightened up their quality control after receiving complaints about the welding.  The package includes LOTS of mounting hardware that allows you to use several options to mount the rack.  About the weight, it is heavier than an alloy rack of the same size, but much stronger and durable not to mention the repairability. I had purchased an alloy rack of a similar design and do not see much difference in weight.  I plan to take some extended trips with my Surly LHT and was not convinced that alloy racks would hold up on rough tow path trails."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5,OR,"""Space saving"" has become a very important feature for us since we bought a motor home.  No matter how big an RV one buys, there is still never enough room.  This duffle bag comes packaged to look just like a laptop sleeve--it folds up that concisely.  It packs away like an over-sized notebook, and I can slip it in just about anywhere without seeming to add any bulk at all.

It is very nice looking, made of tough nylon material.  Stitching is tight and straight.  Zippers are quality and zipper tabs are large enough to grab easily.  It is not a smooth, effortless motion to maneuver the zipper tab around the corners, but it does get around the 90 degree corners without coming out of the track.  There are extra pockets, too, and decent handles.

*I received a sample product from Newport Blvd."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4,OR,"I have not used it much yet, however the well for catching juices is very deep which is what I was looking for."
Electronics_5,5,OR,I have a dive camera that is good but too much trouble for day-to-day pool and kayak use.  I really wanted the Olympus TG-810 but didn't want another $400 camera.  Picked this up on a trial basis just based on price.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Took a bunch of pics in and around the pool and the quality was great.  It's really slow to recycle between shots but all pics were in focus and the colors wonderful.  Love that it has an auto white balance setting for underwater and I don't have to mess with filters.  Will be perfect for kayaking and snorkeling.
Movies_and_TV_5,5,OR,I enjoy ALL the Die Hard movies some more than others BUT this is a must for all Bruce fans.
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,"We had a similar one for my daughter, but couldn't find it and wanted to take my son in the pool! He loves it! The monster in front as well as the attached toys are great for keeping him occupied, and the top is great for shade! Love this!"
Kindle_Store_5,5,OR,"RC kindly provided by the author in exchange for an honest review. Taming Alaska was amazing!! It was a thrilling page-turner with well-developed, witty characters. Cyn was one of the best female leads I've read. She wasn't afraid to speak her mind, went after her dreams (even if they were bad for her), and held her own in the Alaskan wilderness. There were times where the situation was gravely serious and she would have these thoughts that made you wonder about her depth, but then you realized that if you were in her situation you'd probably want to check some things off your bucket list too. Shane was perfect. He kept Cyn safe in some pretty harsh conditions, he was able to make light of a bad situation, while also being serious when he needed to be. Cyn and Shane together were everything. They just worked. But their story isn't finished yet. I can only assume there will be a sequel. And I. Cannot."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5,OR,Love this! I have it in my motor home. We travel extensively and I am on a No Bottled Water kick. It is perfect to make sure we have good drinking water wherever we go.
Toys_and_Games_5,5,OR,Adorable costume for my little buccaneer. She loved it for Halloween and looked super cute. Great price too.
Toys_and_Games_5,4,OR,"My son received both the Stomp Launcher and Stomp Rocket Jr Glow as gifts and he loves both of them. The Stomp Launcher is nice because it doesn't go as high or far so it is a good alternative to outdoor play when it is raining out as it has been here lately. The Stomp Rocket Jr Glow is the one he prefers though because it does go higher and as it has been raining for so long here I closed off the entertainment center and let him play with both in the room with a vaulted ceiling. They are both great, but for different reasons. The Stomp Launcher is a little sturdier, but the step pad is smaller and the cord is shorter so with not as much air the rockets don't go as far but he loves that the rockets look more like a space shuttle style rocket. I suppose if I were to suggest one over the other I would recommend the Stomp Rocket Jr Glow unless you planned to use it inside at all then I would recommend the Stomp Launcher."
Books_5,5,OR,"I will never say that I am too tired, or that I cannot do or take it anymore. My new hero is Regina Calcaterra, a proud Long Islander, who rises to the top despite every misgiving that could be thrown at a child. Despite what the authorities told hershe survivedfinished high school, went to college while working several jobs, and became a lawyer.
Im standing and clapping right now.
Etched in Sand is an eye-opening account of Regina and her four siblingsall with different fatherslife struggles through the foster care and child protective system. This isn't TV where everything is honky-dory. This story brings to lighta foster care system that is broken and full of holes. This is real life and how the lowest form of human beings abuses the system.
Regina lived in the shadows of a heinous, abusive, (add any horrible word you can think of here), and neglectful mother while fending for them self. Dumpster diving for food and clothes; sleeping five across the back seat of a car, or in the trunk when they could. Despite living through the most horrible conditions, anyone could put to wordsRegina, with some help from her two older siblings manages to raise and keep her family together.
When Reginas mother is not out on her month-on-end drinking and sex bingesshe is beating and humiliating Regina to the brink of death. Why you ask? Because the dirt bag of a man who fathered Reginano names here, you have to read it for yourselfleft before Regina was even born. Regina eventually proves who her father was, but she had to live with her mothers wrath every day since he left.
Yes, Regina is my new hero and the foster care and child protective services system will be a better place because of her.
Im not ready to switch political parties just yet, but oh hell, why notRegina Calcaterra for President."
Movies_and_TV_5,3,OR,I swear I think American Dad and The Cleveland show is an excuse for Seth MacFarlane to get quick cash on suckers and idiots to watch this somewhat okay slop! I mean some of it is funny but Family Guy makes it funny from one random joke to another rather having a straight through plot point! I am not expert in criticizing  but I can take a wild armature's guess and get it right when I say this is okay but not close to being good as Family Guy! On the bright side this show has been cancelled but on the dark side American Dad is still kicking!
