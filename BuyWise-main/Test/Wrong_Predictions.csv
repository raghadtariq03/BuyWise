1,0,I fill these up and leave them in the refrigerator. I love not adding more bottles to the landfill.
1,0,"It's been a long time since a book made me cry, and the first time it made me cry both in horror and in joy. It's not an easy read, but like many books that make you work a bit, it's rewarding and I think you will never forget it. Read it if you dare."
1,0,Loved the story and characters. It will keep you entertained and interested in it until the end. The romance and sex is outstanding and the setting is great.
1,0,"Easy to install upgrade for older handles. It fits perfectly as a replacement for older Kwikset locks. The finish is nice, and the handle feels like a quality product. The handle is easily reversible, which I needed to change directions for my door. The SmartKey function was easy to use, and worked the first time without a hitch. I ordered two more to replace the other door handles. This is an easy replacement to update your home, making it more modern."
1,0,Much smaller than expected. I had to purchase another one just so it would be long enough for me to lay down on it.
1,0,the mysteries that involved a young woman who was homeless after the death of her mother.the trouble she found her self i

1,0,We Love it. It completely changed the way our dogs walk. We are very glad we purchased it.
1,0,Packaging in perfect condition and my four year old loves them. They seem to be durable and are painted well
1,0,It's great that i don't have to hear the loud noise of the toilet seat anymore. These work great.

1,0,I couldn't put the book down once I started it.  I always look forward to reading one of his books.  The characters are well thought out and this one was a page turner.

1,0,What a great book!  I preordered this book and read it as soon as I received it.  I'm glad I did.  It was a wild ride with so many changes.  I can't help but be caught up by the plot and action in the story.  I also have to say the author does an amazing job with her character development and world building.  I've been so immersed it's going to be challenging to wait for the next installation in this series.  All and all this was an amazing read and I definitely recommend this book and this series.
1,0,Very easy to install this on our new Fire HD7.  Clear and works well to protect the screen.
1,0,The cable is nicely built with good connectors. It is flexible and can fit in tight places. The connectors have retaining clips so the cable will not pop off.

Also, the reset button don't works, I had to use the one in a modular board I connected on top of if"
1,0,Excellent information to be used in all areas of your life. Reading it for a second time.
1,0,I really like that she keeps everything under 30 minutes. Great workout. If you eat less then you can definitely lose the weight. I use this to maintain and it's a good workout.
1,0,Have this grip on a putter already and wanted another putter to have the same grip.
1,0,I like the color and that it has 2 doors but the latches are a hassle. You have to make sure they are moved out of the way before you try to close the  door and it's takes twice as long since there are 2 latches on each door. The paint is already chipping around the latches.
1,0,"I can't count of the number of times I've been able to squeeze into a tight spot with this ratchet.  It has a nice sturdy construction and the thick ""grippy"" handle lets you spin it even when the handle is at nearly a 90 degree angle."

1,0,Good price and they look lovely on my windows.  I've gotten many compliments.

1,0,I love these they just have a strong denim odor and don't look as vintage-y as the photo because of the wash they have
1,0,I think they're working just right. I've seen some improvement.
1,0,"These socks a so cute!  My daughter is obsessed with all things cat, and these socks are her favorite.  They are durable and have held up well even after several washes.  I will be ordering more when she outgrows these."
1,0,EXCELENT ITEM I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS HOSE IS FLEXIBLE AND VERY EASY USE
1,0,These glasses are a great value.  The quality is as expected for the price.  They should perform adequately.
1,0,My dog drinks from it every time he walks by. And it holds a good amount of water. I recommend it to everyone I meet
1,0,"This is a good shifter romance, with a likeable couple that you want to get their HEA. It is a quick read, just over 70 pages, but the characters are well developed for such a short story. If you are looking for a quick, sweet, and sexy shifter romance, this is a good one."
1,0,"Love it.  Beautiful, reasonably priced, and easy to install."
1,0,This is one of those simple tools that the average rider should have. It works as advertised and is well worth the price
1,0,Its nice to have an organizer large enough for the utensils.
1,0,"Perfect size for my growing pacman frog. He's only a few months old but he loves his new pool. Will likely fit fine as an adult, but we'll see"

1,0,A very good read  that kept my interest and if you enjoy history I recommend this book.  I loved it.
1,0,"This is great for cats that are having trouble keeping weight on, or are ill.  It has been very useful."
1,0,This was an okay read for a short story.  I did enjoy the suspense.
1,0,So nice to just reach over and tap it to turn it off.  They look nice also.  They are small so they don't take up too much room on the night stand.
1,0,I would recomended this DVD. It's a great family movie and you won't mind watching more than a few times.
1,0,Great deal for the price. These provide lots of light and the fixture looks and feels like a high quality product.
1,0,I though a square cake pan would be great but is hard to cut and display on a round cake stand. I will have to purchase a square stand.
1,0,"I have not yet seen the movie, but the book is definitely a good read. There are a few boring parts, but I suggest this to anyone, especially those in sales."
1,0,"Definitely not commercial grade, but it worked fine for my house. I've used a small variety of keystone jacks, and they have all worked.

If one side of the jack is not all the way in before putting the other side in, it can get wedged, which is a minor pain."
1,0,"Actually I don't remember any sexual content, perhaps some innuendo.  This book is highly entertaining.  It is the third in a series about an Indian private detective named Vish Puri.  The first book is ""The Case of the Missing Servant"".  One very serious event in Indian/Pakistani history, the Partition, plays a part in the story."
1,0,"1st class sander, and the case is a very nice touch.  I would definitely recommend it as a finish sander."
1,0,Great birthday present for my 4-year-old niece. Good size. Great Price. Shipped fast. Perfect condition.
1,0,It is actually a good read. I read all of them just to see the hype and I was hooked.
1,0,Great mug! Husband says it is one of his favorites.
1,0,Bought this for my mother as a replacement for an older lamp she had.  She loves it.  She says it was easy to set up and to use.
1,0,"It goes very nicely with the doll house. The only problem I found that I have with it , is that the door comes off. I have to keep pushing it back on."
1,0,My cat loves it! He goes crazy every time he smells it. I have a toy that I add a little bit of it in it and he plays with it for hours!
1,0,A simple cable. Just what I was looking for. Works just fine.
1,0,"Another Carpathian book. I just love the way she weaves these characters.
It is a great book to escape with"
1,0,"Doesn't take up much room in the drawer and it's easy to take apart to clean. It's got a good edge on it and feels nice in my hand.

Edit: One year later this little wheel is still going strong."
1,0,"I am really beginning to fall in love with this series. I love all the mystery and action, I just wish there was more to the relationships between characters. I want to feel a connection with Rachel, or Ivy, or any of the characters. There just isn't enough emotion from any of them. I love the story, but the characters are too superficial."
1,0,"spills easily, but easy for my dog to drink out of."
1,0,"So far it is working great. I changed a few things, were are on day three and the red stage is on the toilet. I first put the red stage where their litter box used to be and kept the extra litter box out. After seeing that they both went in it I took the extra litter box away and moved the red stage to the bathroom. Now that they both used it in the bathroom I moved the red stage to the toilet."
1,0,"Great colors, big pieces, challenges the kids.  Great puzzle."
1,0,"I have 3 dogs, one of which has a big problem with tartar.  I've been using Denta Treat for a few years now and am amazed at how quickly it starts to clean the tartar off his teeth.  I give it to my other 2 dogs as maintenance for a couple of weeks every few months.  Great product, and it saves the dogs having to go to the vet for a dental.  The dogs also love it!"
1,0,"This mat has almost no padding in the bottom, but our dog doesn't seem to mind too much. The bigger issue is that it dries incredibly slowly. Our dog has thrown up on it in the car a couple of times and it's a real pain to clean, then takes a long time to dry, so we essentially need another mat as backup."
1,0,"I enjoyed this book very much.  I would highly recommend this book for anyone who loves a warm, fuzzy, heartwarming story."
1,0,Fun to buy something that has survived the test of time.
1,0,Returned because I thought I was ordering the bed and not the trundle
1,0,The story was ok. It was not the best she has ever written.
1,0,Ainsley finds out more about herself. She is going to pick the next Alpha. She just doesn't know who it will be. This story is well written and has great characters. I am ready for the next book to find out what happens.
1,0,"These are great, I now have three of them.  They are big enough that I can put my car keys in the bag too.  The fabric seems to be durable and the zipper is well constructed.  I see this lasting a long time."
1,0,I love Honey Do products!  I love this over the door shoe holder. I have four of them. Perfect way to organize shoes and keep them off the floor of your closet. I can't live without them
1,0,"My Aussie loves crates, and especially this one. It is well made, large, and easy to clean. He has the best room in the house!"
1,0,"Have bought many Nerf guns for my kids, and this has the poorest performance."
1,0,"great craftsmanship. Perhaps a little more sturdy, the connection between the blade and handle."
1,0,The author made it easy for me to feel as if I were part of the celebration of life and nature.
1,0,"Love the color. Love that it is lightweight.
The bowls are much larger than expected."
1,0,"The pants are well made, we like the cotton and wool fabric and the color"
1,0,A bit tight to close.  But the rubber will probably wear down a bit to make it easier.
1,0,I read dozens of books in 2016.  I am a huge fan of this book.  This was by far my favorite book of the year!
1,0,I love the fit and the feel of the fabric. I will order more.
1,0,Just exactly correct.  Perfect fit and well made.  Great price for this item.
1,0,"My grandson loves this stuffed dog.  It is so soft, and he sleeps with it every night. I purchased two of these so that one stays at his house, and one is available for sleepovers at our house."
1,0,"This is a great holster.  Comfortable, durable, and well made.  It works great for my G43."
1,0,"I purchased this as a gift for my daughters first birthday. The doll is smaller than I expected, but it is the perfect size for my daughter to carry around. I wish it didn't have the artificial fragrance, but it is not overwhelming and better than the smell of plastic."
1,0,"I like this bottle. We can both get a drink. The only thing is that they might want to do something with the doggie cup. I find my dog struggling to get a drink sometimes because of the high back on the cup. Other than that, it's a good cup."
1,0,Looks exactly like pictured. My granddaughter is going to love her hair. This will be her first princess doll.
1,0,"Planning a trip and want to read up on different areas.  This way, we can be a little more informed"
1,0,I put this food down for my cats and they all ran over to the food dish!  The cat food looked good and smelled good and my cats just loved it!  The food came in an easy to open package that was not a hassle to open.  I wouldn't have a problem ordering this food regularly.
1,0,"Cute, I got this for my son (age 8) as a gift for getting good grades. He loved it."
1,0,"As with the second book, this book was a great continuation from the previous book.  The down side is that the story doesn't end with this book and you find out that there will be two more books."
1,0,"Good quality, great colors.  Very pleased with this puzzle.  It is just the right level of difficulty and fun together"
1,0,I never expected to like this movie after reading what it was about but thought I would try it for a few minutes. I was so pleasantly surprised. This movie is fantastic. It is so original and all of the actors were superb. I have told everyone I know that this is a must see
1,0,Exactly what I was looking for. Very comfortable.
1,0,This is a very challenging puzzle but I love it.  It is beautiful and has kept us busy for a week.
1,0,we returned athis bag as it wastoo large for my small sized daughter.
1,0,the love that won out is the story and how people in small towns can be judgemental.the women in this story have to overcome these types of people
1,0,"these are great puppy pads, they don't leak through and for us are the perfect size for our dog pen."
1,0,Easy instructions - love that they are right on the bar! I've ordered 2 now and they are simple and easy to use and look very nice.
1,0,My second one. Hope it is as good as the first.
1,0,End broke off/chewed off in a couple of days.  Returned it.
1,0,I have several of these and love them.  They have a tight seal and hold plenty.
1,0,I'm an accidental collector of these since Amazon has made it possible to buy all of my toy purchases for Christmas from my couch. I have to say this one is my favorite. It is very soft and snuggly. My only complaint is mine is a grumpy bear and does not have the same sweet face as the one in the picture.
1,0,"As always, Kenyon never disappoints!  Love the characters and can't wait for the next one."
1,0,Planning on reading the next one because I'm still trying to find out what's going to happen with her and the Mountie and if she ends up staying in the tundra
1,0,"I first bought a knock off, but it stopped working after a few weeks. The Apple one is still working."
1,0,"This car is awesome! My son loves it and drives it all over the front room, he has crashed it a couple times and the only thing that has happened is a little paint scuff, the body still intact and everything! We love this car"
1,0,"I have a mix feelings about this product. It;s heavy as a shower head but, just the part that goes with the filter (the filter is heavy). The other part is ok. I like the different types of spray. The material is durable"
1,0,"I really loved the tote, well made, a fashion trend. I wanted to keep it, however, I am a small person and it was just too big and overwhelming for my body size. However, I will order other items."
1,0,These were great. I just had to order a longer size.
1,0,"This ball is super solid and secure in the hand.  The grip is good and tight because of the soft, yet durable, outer material.  The ball is solid construction and works absolutely great."
1,0,"This monitor is gigantic, and a pretty good value.  I have really enjoyed using it, enough that I am thinking of buying one and carrying it to work.  I don't know if it really is better on the eyes, but it's beautiful."
1,0,"These are very easy to use, easy to clean, and being able to freeze and microwave is a great boon"
1,0,"as others mentioned - cord kinda small, and the hose is kinda stiff."
1,0,This works just as well as my old Kitchen-aid mixer did and it's not as cumbersome. My only suggestion to the manufacturer is it needs a bowl with a handle.
1,0,I've been using these for a few weeks now and I have had no problems. The build quality is very good on these.
1,0,They look comfortable and well-made but I found that they were too narrow in the toe area.
1,0,Came as described and fast shipping. My dog absolutely loves this toy and it has  lasted for a long time
1,0,Light reading but with high impact. A must for those who would like to have a different perspective in dealing with everyday chaos.
1,0,"Excellent book. Written with a lot  of fact and real knowledge. The author was a Catholic priest who had a lot to do with this subject. I've read this book a few times, and every time, I get really creeped  out. This book is not fiction, and you can tell.  I always come away with a desire to keep up my prayer life and keep going to mass. I'm going to look for his other books."
1,0,I love these Lutron dimmers.  I have them all over the house.
1,0,"Hard to rate all the stories together. There were a couple that were excellent, some just 'meh'"
1,0,"Because the spatula is molded in one piece, it is sturdy and easy to clean. It's not as flexible as my other spatulas, but that hasn't turned out to be a problem.  This thing is impervious to heat--you can use it in a pot or pan right on the stove."
1,0,"A Stairway to Danger is an intriguing novel filled with action and adventure from beginning to end. Tom and Will, two cousins living in a small town in the 1920s, become involved in a mystery when they find the body of the local deputy. Soon, they are investigating a mysterious barge on the river and becoming entangled in a dangerous adventure.

I found this novel to be reminiscent of the Hardy Boy series, except it is geared toward an older audience. The characters are well-thought out and realistic and the author gives the reader a good sense of the time period. Ben Woodard is an excellent writer who knows how to plot and plan a great adventure story."
1,0,This is a great boot and my husband loves it! Bought it as a Christmas present for him.
1,0,"My 12-pound dog likes this one better than the one I had before.  I put this at the end of my bed.  It is tall enough and lightweight yet sturdy.  It does not slide around on floor, the steps are not slick, and it doesn't protrude too much into the room.  I've had this for a long time now and it's still as good as new."
1,0,My 2 month old already loves this! I'm sure she'll continue to have fun with it as she grows.
1,0,Great product! Put into my first build. I'm pleased with the results.
1,0,Fun and really stimulates the mind. Don't have much to say other than it's a cube that can be solved and works like how it is supposed to. Some of the stickers are a little off center. I'm a little picky about that. I'm debating on getting a 5x5x5
1,0,Fits like i wanted it to.  The weather has been too good to use it since i received my order. I like the brand and have been pleased with other purchases i have made.
1,0,"Cute, easy to learn/play game for the kids. My 6 year old loves playing with her friends"
1,0,This is great!  My hubby can have a little bit of the nerd in him in the kitchen without me going crazy.  It's a fun little decor that doesn't take up too much room.
1,0,This wAs a great book and I can't wait to read the other books. It was very erotic and I was aroused the entire time I was reading it.
1,0,My dog would begin for these. The tiny ones are the best for my small dogs.
1,0,It's ok. I get it's a classic but still it's just an ok movie.
1,0,"Decent design, but a little bit too small for me. It should work great for people on a diet."
1,0,The older woman has a long standing affair with a younger while at the same time her husband is having an affair. A beautiful young woman comes into the picture. She is smitten with the young man. The young woman is expected to marry an older man. The story revolves around the personalities and complications in these relationships. The resolution is well done.
1,0,"Can't beat Badger! Sturdy, easy to assemble, fun-to-use products. Our house now looks like a nursery with the high-chair, crib and several other products we have purchased for our 2-year old granddaughter. She loves them all."
1,0,"The image shown with this rod shows that it comes with a stop and a centering guide. These items are not included in the package, and they are the reason I ordered this rod."
1,0,"Good item works like it should.

1,0,"It was suspenseful, had some mystery, moved at a good pace, had some creative thinking and was just fun to watch."
1,0,These foam magnets are great! They have bright colors and are large. My kids love them
1,0,"Recipient loved it, a lot. However, what's not so lovable, is the mess. It's also too expensive, in my opinion. As long as you don't mind the price or the inevitable mess of water and glitter everywhere, go for it."
1,0,This is a really good brush. I like the way it retracts and the hair just wipes off of it. I have a Golden Retriever that sheds a lot. It works great.
1,0,"I enjoy Mr. Ludlum's books.  Since his death, the writers have adopted his style and have done an outstanding job."
1,0,NOT MADE IN THE U.S.A  AS THE DESCRIPTION SAYS
1,0,I love these shoes.  They are very comfortable and perfect for running.
1,0,Cool hand saw. Very well made and very sharp. The handles on this make it so easy to work. The hand saw comes in a nylon case for storage or to carry with you. I received this at a discounted price for my review.
1,0,"Great compendium of Luciano, the best voice of the century."
1,0,I really enjoyed reading this book and can't wait to read the rest of the series. I loved the characters and the story line.
1,0,Arrived Early. Fits great and functions well. Is a great replacement for the plastic original follower
1,0,"The item is exactly what is describe.  So I am giving 5 stars.
But, be aware,  it will have to be placed on the item where you may want to use the item with the adhesive backing.  Be sure to have a place that will be okay to attach with adhesive.  I placed them on the back of my nightstand."
1,0,I'm very pleased with the quality and look of this set and the excellent service!
1,0,"As long as you have an idea of what size Skechers you wear, I would say that these are in the same size range. They are very cute and comfortable, which is what you would expect in a Skechers shoe. I wanted the red striped ones, but those were sold out."
1,0,"Super cute, super soft and super cuddly. My daughter loved it as soon as she saw it. It is her favorite."
1,0,"Too short for my needs, but its a good leash.  I'll just donate it to the animal shelter, that way it isn't a complete loss."
1,0,Served their purpose. Not the best quality and felt cheap. But my kids enjoyed them.
1,0,Such fun for little girls. Pieces went together great. The detail is nice.
1,0,"The rice cooker came with a steamer basket and a rice scooper. The overall design is the standard for a rice cooker. With 12 cups, it's more than enough for me."
1,0,"I am really happy with the quality of this item. It was a very good value for the money. I love the separate compartments. I carry my Lenovo ThinkPad Helix with charging keyboard stand and it fits very nicely. It has a strap to secure it and the compartment is padded. I use the other compartments to carry paperwork, a mouse, charging cables, etc. There is plenty of room and enough pockets and compartments to keep me organized."
1,0,"So far, so good. I've had it for a few months but have only used it a hand full of times. It works well and I haven't had any issues beside with the instructions: they weren't very clear. It appears as though it doesn't work, the first time you use it, unless you press down the button on the back for longer than a few seconds. Other than that, I've had no issues. It works well and a decent price."
1,0,"I liked that I found 3 different sizes of scoops. I use them for a lot of things. Good price, good value."
1,0,Sometimes it is hard to get into a different reality.
1,0,"Seam popped within second use.  Since then the seam has popped in several other places.  We still use it, but I don't know how much longer it will stay in one piece."
1,0,Great for any homeschooling family or anyone trying to teach their children at home.
1,0,"Absolutely love this fabric steamer. It acts like a commercial steamer in that it's very lightweight, easy to use and gets the job done. I would recommend this product to anyone who is tired of ironing."
1,0,I received several compliments on these pants. They look and feel great. I would love to see them hold up for a few years.
1,0,Very enjoyable.  Sad that is was just a novella.  Have enjoyed this whole series.
1,0,"Excellent grinder for me.  I like good coffee, but I am not an expert on coffee."
1,0,Just right!  The color is perfect and the fit is great.  I really like it.
1,0,Well written. Great descriptions. Kept me enthralled. Liked the way characters from the other books were part of the story. Loved it.
1,0,Great value and I have had no issues or complaints with this product.
1,0,Love these. The perfect fit for my 2.5 year old daughter who didn't want to take them off.
1,0,"This thing is the coolest!! It's perfect for my little hands, doesn't have a complicated lock to close, and exactly what I was looking for. I've been wanting a small versatile knife. It exceeded my expectations,  and it will be used daily.

I received a discount in return for my honest review."
1,0,I use this to check my carpet after cleaning to see when it's time to remove the fans. I love it! It seems to be very accurate and is easy to use. I would definitely buy this again.
1,0,Got one of these for each of the kids and for my husband and I.  We all love them.
1,0,"and I keep ordering them for the price. They are one of the least expensive, and I have not had a problem while using them."
1,0,"To be honest, I thought this was a different trick I've seen elsewhere, but the general concept is the same.  The one problem is this is not a trick you can do close up or in high illumination.  The gimmick is very visible and identifiable.  Also, if you have big hands like I do, let's just say this trick is not for you.  It's made for people with small hands.  So I would have to say I was disappointed with the product.  It would be nice if these drawbacks were clearly stated in the product description."
1,0,This unit works fine and the only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is that I would have preferred to purchase the one-button model but it wasn't available at a reasonable price.
1,0,"One of the reasons this series is so much fun to read is we follow a minor character's life as they become the major character of another book.  At the same time, we see what's happening in the other character's lives as they are brought up to date.  Reese was introduced in an earlier book and for me was a very sympathetic character.  In The Seventh Sergeant I was happy to see how far Reese had come and to realize he wasn't as broken as he thought and was worthy of finding someone who could love him as he was."
1,0,"Great classic. The prose was beautiful. The characters were complex and realistic. The social issues were handled really well. This book did a great job of showing the beauties and horrors of life. An excellent read, highly recommend."
1,0,"Very good knife,came very sharp,it is a solid heavy duty knife with a great price."
1,0,Love it! Flying helicopters are so much fun. My cat loves it too. I attach a little string and a toy to it and fly it around the room for my kitty to chase.
