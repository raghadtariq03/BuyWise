"A mind is a terrible thing. The only way you can be a good person is to live.

I had a friend who was a social worker and she had a very large family. She had her own apartment, which was very small. I had to move in and have the people I knew and loved come to live in my apartment. I had to live with them all. I had to have them all. I had to have them all. It was very sad.

I had to be a part of the family. I had to have them all.

There are so many stories of this family, especially from the beginning of the book. I wanted to be part of this family. I wanted to live with them all. It was sad. I wanted to live with them all. It was very sad. I wanted to live with them all.

"Really fun kit to get you familiar with a variety of light modifiers.

Honestly more durable than expected which considering the price is saying a whole lot.

I could nitpick about lil things but honestly, what you get for what you pay is keeping me from complaining.

Pair this with......

"great fire starter.  I took it to boy scouts summer camp, and since i am very new using flint and steel i had to have a scout help me... but aside from that, i was able to start a campfire (once i got my tinder sorted out) and we roasted marshmallows over the hot coals.  the sparks are bright and hot, and they pop and crackle like fireworks (which i enjoyed).
Obviously this is not as easy as a match or lighter, but it worked great and i would highly recommend it especially for someone who knows what they are doing...
Don't forget to scrape off the black coating before usage, and i have been told i should remove the elastic cord that came on it because that makes it harder to strike.
I just bought a second of these for my emergency kit!  They are great and easy to light fires with if you know what you are doing",1

"Liz and Landon have been together the better part of 4 years. She refers to them as peas and carrots. They go well together, but there is not a lot of excitement. They are busy, sometimes ships in the night.

Then suddenly, they are laying it on the line and he proposes. The excitement is back and it it makes Liz want to find a way to keep it! She wants to be strawberries and whip cream instead of peas and carrots. And they have it, at least for now.

The she says to him how about we wait until our wedding night? The bet is on. Whoever does not give in gets the honeymoon they have dreamed of. Liz is pleased even though she wants to jump Landon. Then they are busy trying to pay for the wedding, survive the in-laws, and not get evicted.

Such an amazingly great story! I have not laughed, and cried so much for a book in a while. I was truly impressed and that is not so simple to do. I found the characters sincere and their quest was for the same thing we all want - to be happy we have found the right someone and have the happy after the buildup.

I have to say I cannot wait for the next installment in the All About Love series. The author has really brought her A game to these books, so be prepared to enjoy with plenty of chocolate and tissues.

"Cheryl Strayed's book is at once lyrical, poetic, concise and brutally honest, much like the trail she hikes.

Though toward the end she seems to lose the charming self-deprecation of the first 2/3 of the book, the way she wraps up the book---what every reader waits for---makes every part of taking her journey worth it, and worth discussing.",1

"It fits my camera like a glove, it is not real leather which I like.  I love the light brown color and how protective it is.  The only thing is that when I carry around my neck or shoulder, I keep the cover off, completely off  because it won't just hang, it will fall off, so I keep cover in my purse, and then just carry camera with the main attachment all day when using it.  I wish the cover didn't just fall off...but having the camera so well attached to the main body is super convenient you just pull up point and shoot and let hang again, it won't fall....I get a lot of compliments",1

"Before you go jumping off into Hightech Hysteria, think about what you want to do with what you might be buying. It's almost worthwhile to consult someone who has an iPad or someone who can guide you to what would work best in you personal daily use. This is in most cases not going to replace a laptop, or a desktop computer. The size of the screen is really nice, but then you can't put it in a suit jacket pocket. Nice to have with you, Yes. Easy to leave laying somewhere, Yes. Work with major programs, such as Adobe or FileMaker, only in an emergency and only if the program exists for the iPad (up until now only some mini versions exist). Make sure what you want to primarily want to do, really exists, this i not Mac OS X, this is iOS 4.3. If staying online is that important AND you don't mind carrying it around (it's not heavy, but it's bulky), then you could consider this gadget. It's like a sports car, it's nice to have, but it's not a necessity. What would be nice is something between the iPad 2 and the iPhone / iPad Touch sized iPad mini, that would be half the screen size of the iPad 2. This way, it might not fit in all suit jacket pockets, but could be carried in a shoulder holster or similar carrier under the jacket, sweater or what have you. The larger size to accommodate the over 40 seeing problem and big finger dilemmas.",1

"Never heard about this one, but ended up glued right through to its end. Great find! A dark comedy about a teenager's frustration with setting out on the road to self-discovery and coming to a dead end.

The dialogue is nimble, the music apt, and the screenplay a refreshing change from the pat assembly-line teenybop flicks cranked out several times a year by Hollywood. The plot is peripheral, it's the characters and a fluid narrative that take center-stage.

As delightfully droll but cynical 17 year-olds facing the first challenges of adulthood -- leaving home, getting a job, finding a love life -- the two female protagonists do a fabulous job of coming across as outsiders among their peers never quite trying to ""fit in"".

In what begins as a harmless goof, one of them finds herself drawn to schleppy forty-something Seymour (Buscemi), a regular Joe and collector of 78rpm records. You know Buscemi from character roles in a bunch of popular movies, including Reservoir Dogs; all pent-up cynicism and inherent geekiness, he couldn't be more perfect in this role.

Thrown in are other interesting caricatures of some pretty credible small town characters, notably an art teacher who got more inane with every highfalutin bit of art she expounded on high school kids.

Thankfully, the movie resists the temptation of convenient closures so some may take issue with how it all turns out for the teenage girl and the middle age geek. But it feels more real this way.

What a marvellously done film. Rent it pronto, even the credits are worth it.",1
"I purchased this for my sisters laptop when she broke her USB ports, however she didn't have the PCMCIA slot. The product was exactly what I purchased and was delivered quickly. I did return the item and after UPS charges and a 10.00 restocking fee, I got 11.00 back.

"Needed some long cables to hook up charging stations for my wife and my Kindles at our bed.

These do the trick.  Nicely constructed with solid feeling connectors.

Best thing about these is they are supple but not flimsy.  Many cables have a tendency to revert to their coiled status after long periods of being packaged which makes running behind furniture and such a royal pain.  These go where you put them and stay there, lying flat and not trying to curl up out of reach under the bed.

Most cables are good and these are better than most.  Both ends plug in solidly without undue force and with no feeling of ""slop"".  I've had many that tend to slide back out of the Kindle end of things without warning.  These do not do that.",1

"In my opinion the Galapagos Islands are the most beautiful and the most pivotal islands in the world that supports Darwin's Theory of Evolution and the Origin of Species. It's elegance and strangeness separate these islands more than anywhere in the world. You'll see lava fields, shores and beaches, sea lions, blue-footed boobies, and the albatross and much much more.

The documentary is in three parts, 'Born Of Fire', 'Islands That Changed The World' and 'Forces Of Change'. Two and a half hours of splendor. Wonderfully narrated by Tilda Swinton. The animals, wildlife and beauty of the landscape is captured wonderfully in Hi-Def.

I suggest this film to anyone who loves the nature of our world as well as the Theory Of Evolution.",1

"The Power Wheels Dune Racer (C)

""Dune Racer"" is a spin-off from the original Dune Race, which took place on a beach in the Pacific Ocean.

The Dune Racer is a 3D model of the Dune Race. The Dune Racer is painted in a translucent, dark red, and has a white propeller. The vehicle is powered by a rotary propeller, and the two engine types are a rotary engine and a rotary engine with a number of small propellers. The engine is designed to ""overheat"" and ""plow"" the sand. The Dune Racer is not only a spin-off from Dune Race, but also a spin-off from ""Dune Racer"".

Dune Racer was created by Mattel, and Mattel has a history of making toys that are just as fun as their games. This was the first of many of the Dune Race toys that Mattel released. The Dune Racer was made by Mattel, and Mattel has a history of making toys that are just as fun as their games.

The only thing that I can say about this Dune Race toy is that it is very nice and interesting. I would recommend this toy to anyone. It is really fun to watch the sand come out of the Dune Race.

I received this toy as a gift for my grandson. He is 5 years old and loves it. He loves it. It is very easy to use and very easy to learn. He also loves playing with it and he plays with it a lot. I think it is a good quality toy.Very cute.  The hair is really cute.",0
"For anyone who has ever been in the military, this book is a vivid remembrance of past experiences. For those who served in Vietnam, it is a painful revisiting of a tour of duty that should never have happened. As I read the book and reflected on my own tour in Vietnam in 1968-69, the pain, fear, anger and confusion came rushing back. My life has been forever changed because of the experience as Im sure is the case with many others. The vivid experiences of Shawn McClellan serve as a portrayal of the Vietnam vets emotions. Thanks for validating my feelings. In some small way, it helps.",1

"I've recently moved my old C100 to the office (3 years old and no problems) and picked the Citiz for home. Overall, it's a great looking machine that simply makes amazing espresso.

Here's my quick notes and comparison with the Essenza C100:

- The red and black have subtle differences in the spout and capsule release handle. The black has a chromed handle which makes it look a bit more classier and a different spout shape which I ended up getting. The overall build quality looks a bit nicer on the Citiz than the Essenza but I've only used it for almost two months so I can't comment on reliability but no problems yet.

- The Citiz + milk has a significant larger footprint than the compact c100. However, it does integrate the frother using one plug which is a bonus.

- The folding pedastal cup holder on the Citiz is great for my larger mugs which I had to alway tilt and hold on the Essenza which was a major annoyance.

- The new Aerocinno is amazing ... a much better improvement over the older non-plus version and worth the extra money. The foam taste is a whole lot better as far as texture goes. The only thing is that it no longer uses a clever magnetic lid to keep the extra attachment.

- Overall, the Citiz amd Essenza are equally as good as the espresso taste great with both. I could recommend the Essenza for the cheaper price, in my case track proven reliability, a smaller footprint since the Aerocinno is separate and can be stored away. But for some reason, I'm just drawn to the look and ""presence"" of the Citiz. It's something that looks subtly classy in the kitchen and makes an easy process of making a cappuccino that much more enjoyable.",1

"I am so happy that CC has not only written 3,so far, excellent stories but, also kept them at a reasonable price. I'm so tired of being, personal opinion here, ripped off by authors who have a greater opinion of their ability than may be justified. I believe in paying for the author's legitimate intellectual property. However, looking at prices some of the greater authors, ( Niven, McCafrey, etc), some are having delusions of grandeur. This was a very good story and suspense was palpable. If you liked Anneka, Honor, you'll like this. Not so out there as Nova. Cannot wait to see where Sigrid and the girls go because it's a great big galaxy out there. Please keep it up...",1

"3.5 Stars, I really, really enjoyed this book. It is a super sweet romance and it just soaks in the couple time and we get so many phases of the relationship. Agh. Love it.

Aaron is completely sweet and well a wish fulfillment hero for someone as hurt and angry as Zack. Zack's voice in wonderful with great asides to the read and wry self reflection.

Aaron is a bit of a doormat but there is some nice conflict around making sure Zach and Aaron are partners in this relationship.

As much as I liked it, and I did, there are issues with the writing in terms of unresolved stuff,.

Aaron's relationship with Zach's brother and wife need to be discussed. There is so much co dependency in Aaron.

Zach needs therapy for his childhood trauma.

The plot pacing is sluggish so while even though I enjoyed it, others will be driven batty.
Aaron has no pets. He is a vet. We never get to see his love of animals.

And there is other weird stuff but I liked it anyway, A lot. lol.",1

The only issue I have is I prefer the waistband to sit lower on my hips, but when I do that with this pant, the crotch hangs too low and the material feels ill-fitted when I walk, causing me to have to pull up my pants often, no matter how tight I make the drawstrings.

"I bought this for my fianc, because we live in a bad area.

Pros:
-Much more natural to use/hold than a common can of pepper spray.
-Well built, feels solid.  It has a thick screw in piece in the back (like a flashlight) where you can remove the propellant.
-Detachable keychain is perfect.  It takes a good bit of force to detach, which is good.

Cons:
-Very short range.  We bought a practice spray canister to try it out, and the spray only has an effective range of about 5 feet.  At the end of this 5 feet it has turned into a cloud of mist, so any breeze will reduce the range even further or cause self harm by blowing it back in your face.  But it is still effective as a last resort close range spray.
-Button is easy to press.  Moving it forward and down does not take as much force as I expected, so it seems there is a risk of it going off accidentally in a purse or pocket, especially since the button is raised and can catch onto things.  This has not happened yet though.
-Extremely limited capacity.  the spray canister is TINY.  You only get a few short sprays out of this, or about a 3 second long spray.  This could be a pro for some, as its less likely a bad guy can use it against you once you unload it.
-As mentioned by others it looks inappropriate from the top.  Someone made some bad design choices on its appearance.

While there may appear to be more cons than pros, this serves its purpose as an easy to use, last resort, close range pepper spray.  It feels very natural and is easy to aim/conceal.  Its always ready if its on your keychain and can be detached if your keys are in the ignition.
I would recommend getting a practice canister to get used to how the button works and the aiming/effective range.",1

"Jake Whyte (a woman) is a real genius.  Her dad is a detective, and her mother is a lawyer.  The family lives in a small town, but when a case is brought to court, it is in the name of the victim.  This is a case that should be remembered.  And with the help of a young girl, the family goes to the capital to take revenge on the murderer.  A few months later, a young girl named Elizabeth, a young girl named Rachel, is shot and killed by her uncle.  This is the first time I have ever read a murder mystery where the mystery revolves around the murder of the victim.  It is a very unique mystery that is told through a series of flashbacks.  I can't imagine a novel like this not being a hit.  It is very well written, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a little mystery to keep them entertained.

"We have three generations living in our home so we have the young men trying to gain muscle weight and mature folks aiming to lose a few pounds.  We all agreed we needed a kitchen scale so we could accurately track what we were eating.  So, you can imagine how pleased I was when I received an offer to review this item with no cost.  When it arrived I was so excited.  It looks very sleek, modern and yet classic so it would fit right in with any kitchen decor.  Once, the rest of the family saw it everyone wanted to measure 'stuff' to see how it worked.  Besides the refrigerator it is now our most used appliance in our kitchen.  My sons are constantly measuring pasta, beans, nuts, etc for the protein count based on the serving size. I love the LED display which makes it reading the numbers so easy.  The features are just what we needed as you can: measure in ounces or grams, check the temperature, set a timer and it even has an auto shut off after two minutes of non-use.  The bowl that comes with it is a nice size and we have not needed a larger one yet. Also, maybe you have noticed this but many of the recipes I have been trying from Pinterest and other sites have the ingredients in ounces or grams instead of cups and teaspoons.

"There are 4 levels with manual switch with no fancy lights, however that's just what we need for an air purifier, nothing more. The lowest one is so quiet that I can hardly hear it even I am 2 feet away, the second lowest is still very quiet and good for sleep. The strongest is not to bad either and can get air move fast.

I am washing them really good to be on the safe side. I want to add, there was no sign of water damage to the Amazon box upon arrival. The other blanket was dry and the plastic bag the wet blanket was in was dry. ONLY the blanket inside the bag was wet. This is a good indication it was packaged wet and shipped to me.",1

I really enjoyed this story.  Even though some of the events in the plot may seem familiar to those who like romance/fantasy, Anne did a good job creating a fresh take on those events with her original heroine.

I don't think I've read a book that has a relationship between the two main characters, but I did find that I could relate to both of them. I was just not very happy with the way the book ended. It felt like the main character was trying to make her way back to her life, and the story ended abruptly. I was hoping that the author would have a more happy ending, but I didn't feel it.

"Merton's journal published just five years ago, ""Waking Up"" by Stephanie Plum, was one of the first stories I read. The story took place in a small town in the United States, and was told by a young woman named Mary. The story was told by two young women, and a man named Robert. I learned that Mary had a child named Henry, and had a son named James. This story was told by Mary and Robert, and it was told by a young man named John, who had a son named Henry, and a son named John, who was named John. I had read the book several times, and it was wonderful. I found it a lot more interesting than I would have imagined, and I hope that Mary and Robert will continue to write about their stories.

Mary Plum is a very good storyteller, and I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of the world of the time. I read this book for a group of friends, and they liked it, but I would have given it to someone else.I am always a fan of Julie Kingsolver's writing, and I was very impressed with this book.

"I purchased this toy for my daughters' birthdays (4 and 6), as a shared present, and they love building with it.  This is usually done as a ""group"" project, as some of the pieces are a little bit difficult to snap together for them (but honestly, I have trouble with a few of the pieces myself), but it's been great to see them working together and collaborating on a building project.

I was at first a little worried about whether or not all 400 pieces could be contained in the tote.  Opening the box for the first time dispelled that concern.  The box looked practically empty!  The pieces are very small, and barely cover the bottom of the storage box.  However, don't let that fool you, since you can build lots of things from this seemingly small sprinkle of parts.  The fact that they claim to be compatible with other snap-style building blocks is a bonus.  In any case, there is room for plenty more pieces, should you choose to buy more.

The downside of this toy is that the some of the pieces really are difficult to put together and take apart, and require a good deal of dexterity to do so.  However, given this fact, the finished products are pretty durable because of it.  I remember skinning my fingers as a little girl taking apart my Legos, though, so I'm thinking this might just be a right of passage.",1

"I was excited to see a new Christian DD book because you don't see very many in the DD world. This book was okay the characters were young and still in high school so at times they came off as very immature. The town they lived in and the school they went to seemed a bit unrealistic, the fact that Ashley's father could go from never spanking her to as harsh as was felt unbelievable. Ashley's character really frustrated me the constant back and forth on her feelings for Jackson, and Jackson was really pushy about getting married. Throughout the book we get to watch them go through marriage classes and that's when it starts to feel like a ""how to"" book. There are only a few spanking scenes in this book and only one between Ashley and Jackson.
I would have liked more of the romance between Ashley and Jackson minus everyone else. A follow up would be nice!",1

"I will never say that I am too tired, or that I cannot do or take it anymore. My new hero is Regina Calcaterra, a proud Long Islander, who rises to the top despite every misgiving that could be thrown at a child. Despite what the authorities told hershe survivedfinished high school, went to college while working several jobs, and became a lawyer.
Im standing and clapping right now.
Etched in Sand is an eye-opening account of Regina and her four siblingsall with different fatherslife struggles through the foster care and child protective system. This isn't TV where everything is honky-dory. This story brings to lighta foster care system that is broken and full of holes. This is real life and how the lowest form of human beings abuses the system.
Regina lived in the shadows of a heinous, abusive, (add any horrible word you can think of here), and neglectful mother while fending for them self. Dumpster diving for food and clothes; sleeping five across the back seat of a car, or in the trunk when they could. Despite living through the most horrible conditions, anyone could put to wordsRegina, with some help from her two older siblings manages to raise and keep her family together.
When Reginas mother is not out on her month-on-end drinking and sex bingesshe is beating and humiliating Regina to the brink of death. Why you ask? Because the dirt bag of a man who fathered Reginano names here, you have to read it for yourselfleft before Regina was even born. Regina eventually proves who her father was, but she had to live with her mothers wrath every day since he left.

"I'm a plus size woman (24/26 in pants, 3X in shirts), but only C cup breasts. It's hard to find lingerie that fits the way I want. I'm not one of those comfortable big girls that likes flaunting it or wearing lots of tight things so I definitely wanted something loose. I spent 4 hours browsing multiple sites for plus size lingerie and read every review I could find. I ended up buying this in a 5X because the reviews were mostly consistent with buying 2 sizes up. I was worried it would be too loose on my breasts because of that, but it's not bad. It is a complete halter, so if you want your back covered at all, this isn't for you, but it does fit well if you go 2 sizes up, at least in my case, and the breast coverage seems nearly universal. Theres a lot of material to cover more, but it's tight enough to not be useless on smaller cup sizes. It's obviously not great material, but for this price, you shouldn't expect too much.

I have several nieces and nephews and they enjoy spending time with my daughters but they always leave a mess. These flashing toy rings are perfect for having them entertain themselves for a while without creating a mess.
What I found unique about this ring set is that there were various different styles of ring. From a rose, to bumpy, to spikey to a star! I like the variety of them. This box comes with 36, which is actually a lot more than other types of rings I have purchased in the past. I am extremely glad that this box comes with such variety.
Something to note, is that these rings are sticky like the sticky hands that come from the old school coin machines. I was a little bit surprised at this, because I do not know that this is stated in the listing. I expected a soft gelly plastic, but not the sticky kind. Either way, I did not have any issues with them. Of course though, once my daughter dropped it in the dirt, it got all sticky with dirt. I rinsed it off and it was fine, and it still lit up!
Another great detail is that this flashing light comes with the little light inside that flashes with 4 great colors. Again, this is another aspect I was not expecting. It produced great colors and a very bright light. The quality is superior to any other flashing ring I have purchased for my kids.
These are a great item for parties, or just for keeping the kids busy. Very nice, and made of out a soft material that stretches for everyone. My daughter was able to put hers on her wrist.

"This is an excellently written book - fast paced and engaging. Jon Krakauer is adept at interweaving the history of the LDS Church with a present day story of ""violent faith"".

Based on a ""revelation"" he received from God, Ron Lafferty and his brother Dan brutally murdered Brenda Lafferty (their sister-in-law) and her 15-month old daughter, Erica. The two brothers never spoke of having remorse for what they did. In fact, Dan openly admits to the murder, claiming God wanted him to do it. It is a haunting notion: that someone's thoughts could be so twisted as to let them believe that by killing another human being they were doing the work of God. Krakauer latches onto this idea and examines exactly what would lead a person to commit murder in present day America because of religious believe.

Though the topic is fascinating, it is important to keep in mind that Krakauer only focuses on the extreme parts of Mormonism. He talks about Fundamentalists who openly practice polygamy and the physical and sexual abuse that goes on in those communities. Not all Mormon's are polygamists and not all Mormon's actively seek ""blood atonement"" against their enemies; it is only a small percentage that is so extreme. Before judging all Mormons too harshly remember, every religion has its radicals. Therefore if you do decide to pick up ""Under the Banner of Heaven"", read it with a grain of salt.",1

"We've been purchasing Halo dog treats for the last 10 years. We have a 40 pound dog and she loves them. I am very happy with the purchase. The dog is now 12 months old and she still plays with it.

I highly recommend this to anyone who has a dog that likes to chew toys and toys. I'm going to continue to buy this product for our dog. I'm glad we found this. She absolutely loves it. She just loves to play tug with it. It's got a nice ""top"" and she can't get it off her head. It's a little hard to pull it off her head but she does like to play tug with it. I'm hoping this will keep her from getting stuck on the toy for a bit longer. I'm also happy with the price. My dogs go nuts for these!  I have two older dogs and they all play tug with these. They're very playful with them and they all have fun with them. I also like the quality of the packaging and the fact that it is made in the USA. The plastic is durable and the handle is strong.",0

"~ 5 Levet Stars ~

I love Levet and am so happy for him right now. Ive adored him from the moment he was introduced in the Guardians of Eternity books and I look forward to seeing him in the future books. After what happened in Fear the Darkness , I could not wait to see what happens next for Levet. All the trials, heroism, and persistence in the face of danger has finally paved the way for him to over come his past, put closer on his clan, and get something he has wanted for years.

We are also given a tiny romantic side story, where Levet does his usual match making. It was a sweet story, but I would have loved it to be a novel or a full length of its own.

Levet is a nice novel in the series and we get to see our mischievous and loving gargoyle again. Fans will enjoy Levet.",1

"As far as shower heads go this one works well.  I replaced just a stock circular shower head, and I would say this has as much water pressure as before, enough to get the shampoo and what not out of your hair, however, I do switch on the 'full blast' setting when rinsing my hair just to give it a reason for existing.  I'm concerned about other reviews that say the toggle for this setting will eventually blow out within 6-12 months.  I guess we'll see.  It won't be the end of the world as I'll then get to test some of the other shower heads I was looking at before deciding on this one :D.

I'm giving the product 4 stars instead of 5 just because as stated in another review, the design is a waste.  It's a wider spray, which I like, but the curved aspect of it is totally pointless.  They adjusted the nozzles inwards so that despite the curved designed, that would otherwise spray your whole body (making the head pretty awesome), it all just sprays straight like a normal flat head would.  The curved design is aesthetic only, and therefore doesn't make any sense to me.  I think it is wasted potential and somewhat misleading.",1

"Let's cut to the important part - this product works, and works well.  The litter stays perfectly clean and raked, and I only need to empty the waste bin (easy when you use a grocery bag as a liner) once a week or so.

That's the good part.  The bad part is it's been relentlessly unreliable.  It will jam if you put even slightly too much litter in it.  I've had burned out motors, squeaky conveyors, and busted sensors.  I've disassembled and reassembled it countless times.  That being said, it's a simple machine, and some basic mechanical inclination will allow one to service this accordingly.

My first unit was missing a few minor, non-critical parts, and the motor burned out after a month or so, making a squealing noise from day one that made my cat afraid to use it.  I had disassembled, lubricated, and reassembled multiple times.

I contacted PetSafe, which was awesome.  They sent me an entirely new unit without asking me to return the old unit, so I officially had a new one with an old one for parts.  Since replacing the unit with the new one, it's still been slightly finnicky, but notably better than the old one.  I've still had to make a few repairs, but again, for someone with basical mechanical aptitude, it's not hard.

So yes, it's been less than reliable, but my wife and I love it, and we can't imagine going back to scooping again.  I'd have to say, if this replacement one fails, I'll be happy to replace it with the same unit.",1

"When I was a little girl, I had a wolf ring that I adored bought in some tourist trap Estes Park, Colorado, Keystone, South Dakota, Jackson Hole, Wyoming, someplace like that which I honestly don't remember, but I loved that ring, even though it was a man's ring that only fit on my thumb.  Alas rings that a child can afford are not the best quality and the silver plating quickly wore off my thumb turned green and I could no longer wear it.  When I saw this ring from Moon Wings, a company I have had nothing but stellar experiences with, I knew that I had to have it, but upon reading the other reviews I realized that this ring is very big and clearly a man's ring I changed my size from a seven to a nine and decided it would work for either myself or my boyfriend. It is lovely. There are two things I think the future buyer should be aware of the wolf is not the cuddly sort, he looks to my eye angry and ready to kill, if you are a wolf lover who wants a gentle noble spirit animal, be aware.  Also if you wear this ring as a statement to the viewer of your hands rather than yourself, in other words facing outwards, the little stainless teeth have a real tendency to catch on things and if you wear it the other way to the observer it kind of looks like nothing much just a canine of some description.  I received this product at a discounted price in return for an honest review.",1

"The presentation of this towel really does not do justice to the product. What turns out to be a remarkably good towel arrived looking at first glance like a small lightweight and inexpensive item, but upon using this product, I discovered a VERY absorbent yet lightweight towel and hand towel set. At first glance this set, (I will mainly address the bath towel) looked rather small and lacked volume compared to the average folded towel, but that turns out to be an advantage. My initial disappointment turned to intrigue as I unfolded the generously sized towel, a soft, lightweight and attractive looking bath sheet. What truly amazed me though, is how I could fold the towel down to such a small size that it would easily fit in a suitcase pocket. My next test was to use it after washing my hair. I was amazed at how absorbent it was, drawing excess water from my hair without becoming water logged. The fact that it also dried quickly sealed the deal--this is my new travel towel!
  I love trying out new products, and the temptation took over when I was offered a discount coupon to use in exchange for my hones review. I purchased the blue, and found it to be a lovely and soothing hue very much like the one pictured. I'm glad I tried it,  and I like it! It could use a better presentation, but the product turned out to be great!",1
Item arrived nicely packaged and in good time. I was not as excited about the item once I realized that the poles that come with it only sit in the holders. The package comes with 5 poles and 10 holders and a storage bag. You place the poles on the holder and proceed. You also get a link to an e-book that gives you ideas of how to use the product - which is a nice bonus. I was actually thinking the poles snapped into the holder but they do not. I contacted the seller and was advised that they did it this way as a precaution so the poles will just fall out if you trip or something. I personally would have preferred that they lock in but they work the same as long as you don't trip. As noted the e-book gives you several set-up ideas to use for a variety of workouts. It probably would take two sets to really get a full use out of the system. It is very versatile and made well.,1

"I recently have been training hard (almost overtraining) and had to head into a few weeks of active recovery (still wanted a workout, but couldn't do anything hard on the knees). I bought this DVD in a store for [. ], and can't believe how good it is. I was having serious pain in my right knee, and, after doing this workout a few times, have no more knee pain. My muscles feel lengthened and have recovered quite nicely, and I have greatly improved my flexibility. I love this workout so much I am going to add it in once a week when I start strength training/plyometrics training again. This workout is no joke, however; it was exactly what I was looking for--low impact, but still making me sweat and mentally begging Bob to say we were done holding a pose. He combines some pilates in with standard yoga, which I liked, and still pushes you to your limits. He does tend to make you hold plank a lot, but that was fine for me having to let my lower rather than my upper body recover. He wasn't annoying like some yoga instructors can be--he was encouraging yet demanding at the same time. Some reviewers have made comments about the music, but you shouldn't even notice the music if you are focusing on the moves like you should be. I LOVE the ability to customize your workout as well--great for those who have to work out but have limited amounts of time. Overall, this was a great yoga workout. Having done yoga before as a part of the P90X program, it is a solid workout--and not 90 minutes long like the P90X yoga DVD was. I would highly recommend this workout to anyone wanting to improve their flexibility and strength, or anyone who needs some recovery like myself!

Of course, it helps that I love Bob.",1

"I ordered the season and watched every episode back to back as soon as it became available. Epic! This season parts company from the books because there are no more novels at present, so purists will find a lot to dislike about this season. On the other hand, it is great TV with some fantastic acting by all of the male leads. Kit Harrington, Liam Cunningham and Stephen Dillane are powerful all the way through, and Tyrion and Sir Jorah are a delight as always. Great work from Jonathan Pryce as the High Sparrow.
As for the women, Arya and Brienne continue to surprise and delight, and Sansa gets a bit less like a wet noodle.  Circe is up to her usual tricks but as Bronn says, evil has a tendency to turn back on itself. Margery and her gran, the amazing Diana Rigg, rounded things out pretty nicely. Not much movement from Queen Dany but we are left with all sorts of interesting possibilities in the final episode.
There are a lot of unanswered questions at the end of Episode 10 and throughout the whole season with respect to Bran, and for the past 2 seasons with regard to Rickon and the wilding woman who was supposed to find somewhere safe for him. Episode 8 shows there is nowhere safe from the Whitewalkers.  Great special effects and settings round off an excellent season, not perfect, but certainly better than most things on TV these days. With any luck, there will be many more seasons to come.",1

The first one I purchased was a little large.  I had a 2x4 bench and it had a very large gap on the front edge of the bench.  It had to be able to go to the front of the bench to get the gap closed.  I would not recommend the smaller one.  I am not sure how long it will hold up to the heavier ones.  I do not have a bike and I don't know how long it will hold up.  I will update if I get a chance.

"A fun, gay twist on the Cinderella story....a Cinder-FELLA story actually.
I wasn't sure what to expect with a hero living as a woman in his step-mother's home, but I ended up loving Cinder's humor and innocence. From glass slippers to fairy godmothers, evil step-sisters and Prince Charming, all aspects of the classic tale are there, just with a clever twist for the mm romance reader.
When Cinder goes to the ball in a beautiful gown and meets the prince, I was so nervous for him!!
Without giving anything away, Cinder gets his happily ever after....whether or not he's still wearing dresses though I won't say, LOL.

"Dog lover might be an understatement for my fascination with this species but this book only reinforces my tenuous claim to sanity in light of the fact that seven dogs currently live with me. The fact that we can trust these animals with our confidences and emotional turmoil much more than most of our human companions is substatiated in Katz' writings about dogs. They are trusting and loving to a fault and yet do demand a commitment from us that far too many people do not take seriously. Thus we hear, ""It's only a dog."" The lessons learned by children and adults from dogs are important and should not be ignored or downplayed by the,""only a dog"" remark. They too love, feel pain and joy, and  suffer many of the travails of their human counterparts. For many children, coping with the loss of their dog is the first experience of death. A dog may also be their biggest source of comfort in the loss of another family member. The importance of this partnership should never be downplayed and Katz treats this with respect and brings it to light especially for those poor ""dogless"" people.",1

"I'm an owner of a recording facility and I've been creating music and commercials for the public, for 26 years now. Most people never see the cables that we use, so let me give you the idea.

For instance I have about a dozen 8 channel snakes with the  inch ends that are interconnects to and from the console to rack mount effects and processors and or the in and outs of 16 channel sound cards. The cables used within these snakes are as small as can be used for convenience. They have molded plastic ends with strain relief and they are bundled into a flexible tube with about 18 inches of free cables at both ends.

There's another version that's a 16 + 2 channel snake into a room for live drums that allows for low Z microphones to be plugged into it, there's 18 tiny, thin cables within this snake. That one is 50 feet long.

When people are impressed by large diameter cables, I know that they haven't been educated in what's needed, that they've been educated by advertising.

This is a great cable that has what's needed. I tested it's shielding by listening with cranked up headphones and running it over sources of EMF and heard nothing. It's soft and flexible making it tangle resistant and it has strain relief. The fact that it's thin is convenient, it does not reduce the performance one bit.

So the picture may show what appears to be another cheap cable, but this one is a couple grades better than those. It will feel different, it's smaller and easier to work with and I'll bet that it's interference rejection ratio is higher too.

Really, if you want 5 feet of Tip-Ring-Sleeve stereo, line level cable for any use, this cable is very close to perfect and I recommend it. I'm using it in my recording facility when needed without issue.

Thanks for sending me this nice cable to test and review.",1
Thames and kosmos never fails to do the trick. I will admit that my daughter was pretty bummed when we had to replace the batteries. The plastic was a bit rough and broke easily.

"What a terrible end to this series.  I loved this character and her gargoyles from the first novella that I read but this book was technical with almost no heart or development for the few characters there were.  I was completely bored with the formation of crystals and what it took to form the crystals.  I felt like I was in a cave forming crystals through out most of the book.  That is what I mean by the book being too technical.  If there was such a thing as gargoyles, this would be the manual on how to make your own gargoyle. The writer spent way too much time on that and not enough time on developing the romance and bringing life to the final story in this series.  I miss the people and the gargoyles from the previous books.  This book felt like a novella that was dragged out.",1

"Due to the circumstances and the financial problems with the film, it's difficult to imagine what the film is going to be like. The script and directing have been superbly executed, and the story is well told. The acting is strong, and the performances are always excellent. The film also has a very good cast, and it has a very good ending. I think the ending is a good one, and I'm not sure if that's because it's a good ending, or if it's just because it's the ending. I think the ending is a little confusing, and that's what makes it a little more confusing. If you want to see a movie that is full of action and laughs, I recommend this film. It's not a perfect film, but it's a good one. I highly recommend this movie for any fan of action. It's a good movie, but not one that you'll be very happy with. It's a lot of fun to watch and there is a lot of action in it. The plot is a bit complex, but I really enjoyed it. The acting is excellent and the plot is a bit convoluted. It's not a bad movie, but if you're not a fan of action, don't watch it.",0

"I walk on a treadmill for exercise & wear an orthotic insert. The size shoe that accommodates the insert is loose & slips around on my foot while exercising. I have come up with a variety of techniques to compensate: multiple shoe laces, moleskin padding. A thick sock is essential. I ordered 2 pair Thorlos Women's Thick Cushion Distance Walking Quarter Socks April 14, 2010 @ $12.59 a pair, free shipping form Footsmart w/ $25 purchase. The socks were indeed very thick and worked well protecting my foot from pressure & sliding. I ordered 2 new pair Nov 19, 2010, same item, same price, same shipping deal, but not the same sock. These are significantly thinner, when I opened the package the difference was evident. I thought perhaps the original socks had shrunk in length in the wash producing the thicker cushion. However when I tried them on the length was already snug so that hope died and subsequent washing did not affect the cushion. The socks are not bad socks but I would never have invested another $25 if this is what I had rec'd the first time.
 Bottom line: if you are looking for the sock you purchased before: this isn't it. If you are looking for a very thick, cushiony sock: this isn't it.

Additional comment, 3/26/2011. I retained the packaging from my later order hoping to compare to the previous order & get a clue to the change. These socks were 'small.' This accounts for the smaller overall size but not for the change in padding. This is another example of inconsistencies from merchant to merchant & product to product. Most pages for socks have a selection for size on the page. Here there were different pages. My search for style & brand took me to this product as the size I ordered previously is no longer available on Amazon.",1

"Margaret OMalley, a 13-year-old girl living in the small mining town of Victory, Arizona, has just found out that her father, a whistle-blower geologist, not intimidated by Victory Fuels bad practices, has been sentenced to death for arson and murder by the vindictive Judge. Desperate to help her father and save his life, Margaret is assured by her best friends grandfather that she has the special ability to do so.

Charlies grandfather, Joshua Garrett, has a complicated history with Victory and the coal mining company that founded it. The Garrett family moved to the dry desert climate of Arizona to alleviate young Prestons asthma, but when Frederic Garrett went to work in the mine, the family began to experience another form of hardship and danger. Frederic Garrett and his friend Aristotle Agrippa, along with many other miners, take on Victory Fuels, but the cost is high.

Decades later, their actions result in John OMalleys conviction.  The secret, both OMalley family and Joshua Garrett kept, is that they are able to time-travel. Grandpa Joshua hopes that sending Margaret back in time to the moment his friend Luke Agrippa becomes the hard-hearted Lucas Biggs will save her father and rectify past wrongs.  But Grandpa Joshua and Charlie quickly learn that trying to change the past is not enough, so they turn their attention to find a plan to save Lucas Biggs

The threatening execution of John OMalley subsidizes the story with painful strain, but hopefulness, and ethics in standing up for what is right, resisting corruption makes up for that tension and pain. Despite the OMalley ability to time-travel, the elements of fantasy are actually kept to a minimum, bringing the story to a factual resolution. The story starts with these questions and takes readers on an exciting adventure within the heart of several genuine characters.",1

"By any name William H Keith, Jr. writes good books. This one is written under the pen name Ian Douglas. Set in Earth's far future, this book delivers. There's lots of action, a main character with a troubled past, and a host of alien races. The alien look and think differently than humans, which makes it all the more engaging.
Lieutenant Gray is a fighter pilot with good instincts, but when the Sh'daar issue an ultimatum, he joins the space navy to protect his home world. The odds seem hopeless.

"I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

The first book in the series, the Bride of the Bride, is the first of the three in the series. It is told from the perspective of a young woman. This book is a great introduction to the story. It is a quick read and will make you feel the emotions of the characters.

The main characters, Cara and Ethan, are on a journey with a group of people who have been close to each other for years. They have been together since they were little. They have a great connection, but have a different way of talking about it. They have a lot of issues, but they are able to overcome them.

This book is about Cara and Ethan. Cara is a single mom, Ethan is a single father who is raising a son in a small town. Cara is a single mom who is dealing with a loss. Ethan is a single father who is dealing with a divorce and a lot of guilt. Cara and Ethan have a connection that is going to be hard for them to forget.

This is a great book. I enjoyed the story and the characters. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys",0

"There are movies for all moods, for all tastes, for all
occasions. Some emphasize the dialogue, some the special
effects, others the story.

In this movie, there's a wide range or aspects that are
keep the viewers keenly watching the unrolling of the
movie, such that time passes quite quickly, and we get a
glimpse of a microcosm, surrounding the customers of a
small 7-11 style store in a major city.

William Hurt, plays a character that seems quite his own,
and natural, as does Harvey Keitel who reprises the
tough-guy with a big heart role.

The movie is not a chick-flick like many other movies,
such as Ashley Judd's SOMEONE LIKE YOU/ ANIMAL ATTRACTION
but it does have a very soft or human side to it, that
will appear perhaps to older audiences, meaning, those
over 23 ...since the emphasis is on the various tones of
human interaction, the small and introverted lifestyles
that sometimes people have in large city neighborhoods.
The key here, is showing people their human sides, and
willingness to grow, help their neighbors, and life in
peace with one another, responsibly.

Clearly, these types of movies, showing nostalgia, mixed
with urban living, realism, drama and responsibility in
each moment, are not the norm, considering the ""fantasy""
or ""unreal"" stories often chosen by Hollywood, that target
the below 17 age bracket.

Perhaps, at the end of the day, everyone will learn to
enjoy this small urban tale featuring OUTSTANDING acting
talent of William Hurt, and the legendary Harvey Keitel.

As for Ashley Judd, an extremely versatile and one of my
favorite actresses, she really does a shocking role in
this movie, playing a delinquent adolescent girl, not
unlike the other movie, NORMAL LIFE. This is the old Judd
that we used to see, in other movies of the same period,
such as Ruby in Paradise, or the Passion of Darkly Noon,
or a Time to Kill, or the Locusts, all great performances
with Judd. The later movies, seem to show a Judd in a
different phase of her life than before, but in
SMOKE, Judd's 5 minute performance will surely grab your
attention.

In terms of the DVD edition, the colors, sharpness of the
picture and audio, is top-notch.",1

"Bought by Nicolette Hugo

Designation: Standalone, 302 pages

Nicolette Hugo is a new author for me and she is one I will be looking for in the future.

The blurb is very accurate, but it really only tells part of the story.  We begin with Killian Bailey trying to rescue his wife who has been kidnapped by the cartel. He saves her, but not before she is permanently harmed.  Killian is also scarred by his failure and puts all his effort into getting revenge on the man who took her.

Although, Scarlet Bailey loves her husband she misses their intimacy since he is punishing himself for failing to protect her so she calls on Jerricho Black, Dom for hire.  Once Killian finds out, he hires Jerricho for 40 days.

So this is quite a complicated plot.  At times it seemed a bit choppy or maybe it was just because there were a few different stories going on.  I really enjoyed the dynamics between Scarlet, Jerricho and Killian.  Jerricho definitely had a complicated past and then the relationship between Scarlet and Killian was unique.  A few times I wanted them to just say what they wanted.  It was one of those books where no one was willing to admit what they wanted and they each thought that what they were doing was protecting the others. Overall we did get an HEA although not a full epilogue.  I still want more.maybe a book 2.

There was also the excerpt from Exhibition at the end which was very intriguing and is now cued on my Kindle.

Hero: Killian 5 stars, Jerricho 5 stars
Heroine: Scarlet 5 stars

I think I had it turned to the brightest setting for about 2 1/2 hours using the inexpensive alkaline batteries you get a Horror Freight before the light dimmed too much to continue.  The headband is comfortable enough that I forget that I am wearing it while working.

"H. Paul Jeffers's biography of Grover Cleveland is readable, but I found myself thinking of the famous Walter Mondale phrase, ""Where's the Beef?""  Checking in at a brief 350 pages, made all the shorter by the interspersion of photographs throughout the text, this book is a good bare bones account of Cleveland's life in which the reader never really gets to know the man.  Cleveland is a vastly underrated President, mostly because didn't serve at a time of great national crisis.  So the recent interest in him (no less than two biographies published in 2000) is a good thing.  Jeffers's book did much to enlighten me, but left me wanting more.  I also found a couple of glaring factual errors.  Overall, Jeffers's book is a good introduction to its subject, and that's probably all most casual readers will want to know.",1

Quick read - alternating points of view
Let me start off by saying the story itself was ok. There were a few errors that were distracting/confusing. The reason why Robyn was kicked out at age 15. The whole family dynamics was off. There story in the beginning of the book was not what was revealed at the end. the relationship between Garrick and Robyn pretty much happened over night. Robyn was very independent and she worked hard to pay her bills and finance her degree. Garrick wanted to take care and protect her. He was possessive and bossy. They clashed a lot. But the make ups were hot and sexy.
There was a lot of drama in a short period of time. Robyn became a magnet for trouble. Near rapes, stalkerish ex, drug dealers etc. Everything wrapped up nice and neat in the end.",1

The plastic lid is a bit difficult to open.I had this for a few months, and it was perfect.  I ordered two for the party.  They are both the same size, and the right size.  I like the size of the top, but I like the size of the bottom.  It's very easy to store, and I don't want to mess up the counter top.  I also like the fact that it has a little lid.  I do like that it doesn't have a screw lid on the bottom, but it's a bit of a hassle to get to the bottom if you want to store it.  I don't have to worry about the metal going up.  I also like that the lid is not too big.  I also like the fact that the bottom has a plastic lid on the top.  The lid is about the size of a large cookie sheet, and it's very easy to store.

"While no cat litter is fantastic at least this is organic and does not contain Silica. Clay litter may seem safe however our perfectly healthy 14 year old cat developed a lung condition, like silicosis, which caused from silica in CLAY LITTER. See http://petmac.org/arl/whats-the-big-deal-about-cat-litter/ for more information.  Even the ""dust free"" clay has dust...so 99% dust free compared to what?  We have been using the Blue Buffalo cat litter and like it. Yes it has some dust but it is NOT silica AND while it may have a bit of a strong smell when you first put it out, by the second day it is gone.  It clumps well, maybe not quite as well as clay but again it is not cancer causing. CDC, OSHA etc ALL have warnings about silica which is in Clay Cat Litter. Personally these manufactures not only do not care about our environment, they do not care about pets because if they did they would not put this poison on the market to hurt animals. Not only did we lose our recent little cat to this but 2 years ago we lost another one to lung cancer. We started doing research and this made perfect sense. Oh, both were big diggers and scratchers in the cat litter thus creating more of the dangerous dust. Please just stay away from ALL clay litters.",1

"Amazing book! I'm looking forward to more books by this author.

Thanks for the opportunity to read this book.  The author, Danielle Hutton, is a wonderful writer.I enjoyed this book.  It was good, but it had some issues with the story.  The first one was a bit predictable, the second one was a bit more interesting.  I really liked the first book, but I felt like there was too much emotion.  It's very hard to tell if a book is about a romance or a serial.  This one was a bit more of a romance/serial and a little more of a story.  I can't say enough about the characters.  I would definitely recommend this to my friends.  I can't wait to see what happens next.I have read many of the author's other books and have never found myself wanting to read more of them. I found myself wanting more of the characters and their story. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to all.The story was great.  I loved it and would recommend it to others.I'm very pleased to say I've read all three books in this series.  I have loved every book they have had.  They are so full of life, and love, and love.  I can't wait to read them all.  I can't wait to read the next one.  I'm sorry, but I can't wait to read the other three books!This book was really good.  It's very short and sweet.  I enjoyed it.

After a few months, the adapter would lose connection for about a minute every so often.  As more time went by, it'd get worst and worst eventually leading me to abandon it all together.  It wasn't THAT bad, but two or three times a day was more than enough for me to give it up.",1

"Dropping to 3 stars as it is not really ""non slip"", the white dots are not scratchy whatever to keep you in place, they are just deeper pieces of plastic.... Definitely not a step stool you want to use if you are actually wet, like out of the swimming pool or bathtub wet... unfortunately it took a fall for us to look at it a little closer and see they were not slip grip things.

"I picked this machine up at a garage sale for 10 bucks. It was used once and still in its original box with everything it came with. I figured it was worth a try. I roasted a 5.4-lb chicken and took note of the useful tips I saw throughout the reviews here. Spray the back plate and prongs with cooking spray, line the drip tray with foil, tie the legs and wings to hold together tightly, put it on the rack with the legs facing away from the motor. In 80 minutes it was done without any problems. It was the juiciest chicken we've ever had, very tasty indeed. You cannot get this from your oven, no way. The complaint of some about the heat this puts out wasn't a problem. I have a ceramic cooktop and it was just fine on it. I can't wait to try turkey breast or a very small turkey.
I took one star away for the following: the rotators sometimes have a skip or delay because one wheel sits on the other without any additional latch to keep them together. For chicken roasting this is less of a problem, but I can see lighter foods or unbalanced loads have an issue. There is no on or off button, instead you have to unplug to turn it off and there is no pause button to stop the rotisserie to check for doneness, you have to unplug to stop it. Was it worth $10? Heck yes, would I pay the regular price? Probably not.",1

Initially I was going to get the burgundy color one but they didn't have my size. I am glad I got the blue instead. As it was a nice purchase. It doesn't look like the picture provided by the seller. Nor does it look like something I included in my picture in this review. However its just a nice sky blue colored sweater. Its 100% cotton and didn't irritate my skin. Plus the price point of the sweater was nice as many sweater similar can cost much more. I did receive this product at a discounted price for my review. However this is one of those products that even if I didn't get a discount I would think it was a nice purchase. Just a heads up for style purpose. If you like the modern and slim fit than the sizing should be normal. I got my size and it fit just right. Not sure how it will come out after I wash it though. If you like your sweaters to fit a little loser than get a size up. That's my suggestion and input.,1

The book is a good read.  It keeps you guessing until the very end.  You will be in love with this author.

The author has a great way of telling the story.  She uses lots of language to convey the emotions that she feels.  She gives you a feel for the place and the people in the book.

"Overall - 2.5 stars
You can have the werewolf and eat the cheesecake too. This is a BBW paranormal romance with all the usual elements.

Fantasy World - 2 stars
The world is a bit ragged around the edges, and you'll definitely need to suspend disbelief to enjoy the story.

Tingle - 3 stars
A hot, naked man shows up on the doorstep, and wants to get busy. What's not to like? The sheik scene is more odd than hot though.

Characters - 3 stars
Full of hot, Alpha werewolf stereotypes. Carole's self-esteem issues become tiresome, and I desperately wanted her to get a clue.

Story - 2 stars
The plot is a well worn path. Nothing new, but it's still fun to take a stroll down it.

Summary
When Carol Anne goes to claim a surprise inheritance from her dead Uncle, she doesn't know it includes a sexy man showing up on her doorstep to provide erotic delights. She's trying to recover from her divorce, and plans to live alone in the country. Unfortunately, Carol Anne doesn't know she's actually close to a hidden werewolf town, and is smack in the middle of a fight between werewolves and panthers.

My Wolf King by Rose Wynters is a fairly standard paranormal romance with familiar elements. It's not going to rock your world, but is more like snuggling into your favorite sweats with a side of cocoa and cookies. You get to visit with hot men who know their mates at once, and a real sized woman who is valued for being more than a twig.",1

"My Thoughts:

After the intriguing start, it was a long ride for me. There were a few moments when I wanted to jump in the story. Not that I was disappointed. The chemistry between the characters was well written and the chemistry between the main characters was hot and steamy. The storyline was well written. I liked the characters and I enjoyed the interaction between them. There was also a lot of plot twist and turns. I liked the story. It was an interesting read and I'm glad it ended. I enjoyed the romance between the two main characters. I liked that the main character was a little more mature. I like that the story flowed nicely and kept my interest. I did like that the book was longer than I thought. I loved the story and didn't like the ending. I was a little disappointed that the book ended in a cliffhanger. I wish it had been longer.

Overall I was a happy reader and a happy book.

"When I set out to buy a slow cooker for my mom, I was looking at higher models with all the bells and whistles and the convertible ones that are like 7 different kind of pots in one.

After viewing just about every offering on Amazon, I settled on this one because I liked the locking mechanism in case mom ever wanted to take her culinary delights on the road.  Knowing how picky mom is and how unhappy she would be if she didn't like it, I held my breath, hit buy and continued to hold my breath until it was delivered and the final verdict came in ... Then one day I got an excited call from a very happy, gourmet-chef mom who loved this slow cooker!  She uses it at least 3x/ wk and I get to hear about all the amazing things she's been cooking in this baby :)).  Mom especially likes the locking mechanism and how it easy it is to clean.  The cooker heats up quickly, cooks evenly and definitely does not spill when taken for a ride. Then she mentioned how relieved she was that I didn't send her one of those ""other"" ones ... Lol.",1

The crate is NOT meant to be used for a puppy that is going to grow into a very big dog (such as a Golden Retriever or Labrador).  It is just not sturdy enough for a big, strong willed puppy.  In that case, get the crate the puppy will need as an adult and use the barrier the comes with it to divide it when the pup is little.

This crate is meant for a small dog, therefore a small puppy. And for that, it is perfect.  The double set of doors allows you to set it up in a variety of locations and still have access for the pup.  We currently have it set up lengthwise with the side door left open for easy access.  The puppy can come and go as he pleases to access his pee pads at night in the kitchen, and then return to his crate to sleep.  He LOVES his crate and willingly runs to it at night to lay down and sleep while we babygate him in the kitchen. When compared to the generic crate that I have, the MidWest crate is made from a higher gauge wire, it assembles together tighter, and it just seems sturdier overall. The plastic pan is a heavier weight and is holding up well.

I definitely plan on always using MidWest crates in the future.",1

"This quick and easy to read book is exactly what any struggling alcoholic needs. It's straight to the point with very little fluff. Filled with numerous tips and ideas that are easily follow-able. I found Chapter 4 the most inspiring. Chapter 4 is entitled: ""Real Life Success Stories."" There is nothing more encouraging and/or motivating than reading about other people who have overcome this horrible addiction. Thank you for this quick guide.",1
handy tool for camping but doesn't really crank out the heat,1
"The author builds an emotional tale with well-developed characters.  I think it is worth cautioning readers that are sensitive to the issue of rape that a central element of the story is a woman dealing with her feelings after such an event. The heartbreak and turmoil of such medieval pillaging is part of the nature of Saxon attacks on a rural Roman villa in England. The tale is of love and triumph but real in the brutal reality of the period.

With the death of the men of the farm, the women are left to survive and go on living. They struggle to survive from meager food stuffs while rival powers exert influence on the villa women.  The story has sad elements but Diana, the eldest surviving daughter of the land owner, captures your heart with her courage.

This is a giving, loving, romance story with the thorns and pains that are real in life.

I have to say I like the cover art too.",1

"This would work fine for pistol casings but for rifle rounds ( which is why I bought it ) it does nothing to resize the neck. I bought a .223 die set to reload. I let a friend come over to use my press because I am trying to get him into reloading while I ran errands. When I came back he got the casing stuck in the decapping die. This had never happened to me so I checked youtube for some advice. This did not go well and the rod was damaged getting the casing out. I logged on to Amazon searched for .223 decapping die. This POS was the only one found. I didn't read the details that this was a one size fits all piece of trash ( we all know one size fits all rarely works ) Since .223 was in the description it pulled it up and I the unknowing unexpecting consumer ended up buying a $16 paper weight.

"My son actually wore out his videotape copies of Scooby Doo and the Cyber Chase, Zombie Island, and Witch's Ghost. That's how much of a Scooby fan he is and has been since he was first introduced (he's 10 now).

This is actually a much better movie than some of the latest efforts (e.g. AbracadabraDoo) in my son's opinion. It was scarier (I think Zombie Island and Witch's Ghost are scary too and he agrees) and less ""campy"" then some of the others we've watched lately. He was mesmerized by it from the moment it arrived - and has watched it several times. I thought the music was good and the voice acting decent enough. A bonus episode from the TV series is included which my son enjoyed as well.

In the end we'll collect this one just like the others. We have a whole shelf of Scooby movies and shows. Since this one has already been watched a couple times it's definitely going up on that keeper shelf!",1

I would recommend these to anyone who is looking for a pair of shoes that will keep them warm for long periods of time.Great product, very easy to assemble and close.  Easy to install, but will be a little difficult to get the screws in place.  Easy to put together, but doesn't have a lot of tools.  I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend to any customer.Very good product. Very good for the price.very goodI love this little bag. I have a 10 year old who loves it. I love it.

"These bags are much larger than I expected them to be.  It's been a while since I've purchased some, but I don't recall them being so big. They do the job! Makes picking up the pup's messes a lot easier, and a whole lot more sanitary. Especially for my elderly father.  He has a time trying to pick it up with toilet paper without getting it on him or something else.....these are a MUST HAVE item in my house since he's living with me. This will also save money on toilet paper.  My pup is trained to use the potty pad inside, and also to go outside. He's a pomeranian, and I trained him this way so that when it rains or snows, he will be able to go indoors. It's been so nice to not have to get all bundled up in the winter and brave the cold, snow and ice. They've already come in handy, and will last a long time. I know who to get them from now when we run out. The container to keep them in is small, and easy to clip to a belt loop or leash, and am able to grab one easily. The bags are also a good thickness. Some I've purchased in the past were a little thinner than these. If you have a pooch you need to pick up after, these are great to have on hand. They do have a slight odor, but I think it's just the plastic itself. It's not terrible, but is noticeable upon opening the box. They aren't scented with perfume, thank goodness!  I was able to purchase these bags at a discount, not free, for testing and review. Regardless of price paid, it has no bearing on my actual opinion of the product. I rate 1-5, and rate 5 when I would purchase again.",1

When a couple of kids are together one or two can shop and one can take turns being cashier. They love scanning random things and hearing the voice say a price. They love getting on the microphone saying, ""Clean up in aisle 7"" type stuff. My sister who has oodles of toys for visiting nieces and nephews had this for years and I have watched kid after kid happily using this toy. Hers is still working and it has through rough toddlers and kid tussles etc. I just bought this one from Amazon for my grand-daughter.

"There are some things I like about this product and some I do not.  As with most tools models, brands, quality, what the tool is being used, cost and other things make a buying decision.

This is not a top of the line model or and I wouldn't recommend it for heavy industrial use.  However, for home use or its intended use is light then this drill will work for you.  There is no need to spend lots of money on a professional model.

Everybody holds and uses the same tool differently.  I didn't really like the feel of the tool in my hand.  It just doesn't have a comfortable quality feel.  But then I prefer top of the line tools, they usually pay you back in useability, durability and quality of work.  But then this drill may be ok for you.

"I was so surprised by how large this actually is. My dogs love it. Packaging is great, but a little wasteful.

I have used this now for a couple of weeks and I really like how it looks and how it is so easy to open. The only negative is the plastic part on the handle is a little bit too hard to open.

"I have used electric pressure cookers in the past and each one has died within the first year of use when the electronics simply went haywire.  I've wanted to try a stove top model but was hesitant remembering the behemoth my mother used to use.

As soon as I saw the Clipso by T-fal, I knew that it would be the model that I would get the most use out of.  It is large enough for my needs without being too large.  The top goes on super easy and using the pressure cooker is as simple as reading the instructions.  Cooks great.  The rubber gasket should be replaced annually and knowing T-fal for a quality company, I am sure that the gasket will be available for a long time.

While portions of the pressure cooker are dishwasher safe, I will probably just continue to wash it by hand.",1

"I hate to give one star to any book but this was really awful. Perhaps the story would have been better if I didn't have to stumble through considerable editing difficulties. Whoever was in charge of this department at Warner books should have been fired. My copy is the first edition and there were numerous punctuation problems. So much so that it detracted from the story. I have never, I repeat never, read a book with this many mistakes. Willa Hammer headed west after losing her adopted family. Settling in the Bighorn Mountains she comes upon various melodramatic characters that think only of themselves. One of the characters just grated on my nerves. You'll know who it is without naming names. Smith Bowman, the hero, is a loner in many ways. When he meets Willa he is leery of her at first. In denial, he doesn't want to admit to himself that he is attracted to her. It scares him. Of course, we know how the story ends. If you find another edition without all the mistakes AND if hokey language doesn't bother you, you may like this romance.

"So to start off with, the top part of the shoe is a little bit too large. It is so small that it looks like a small shoe, but it does not look like a regular shoe. It is not even a thin elastic.

I do wish it were made of a slightly softer material, but it is not. Overall, it is a nice shoe. It is a nice looking shoe. It is a good looking shoe. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.

So I've been reading this book for the last two years and it's always a pleasure to read. I had a friend who was a social worker and she had a lot of fun reading this book. It was a very interesting story about the lives of people living in the south. It was a great read. I read it several times over the course of a month and it made me want to get back to it. I'm looking forward to getting back to it. I have read all of her books and the series has been really good. I was actually not sure if this was a good book but it definitely was. I read this book first to get the idea of the book and now to get to the actual content. I can tell you I was a little worried that this book would be the last book in the series but I was glad I didn't. It was really well written and really kept you guessing as to who was who. I really enjoyed the interaction between the main characters and their personalities. I loved the idea that they were so different that it was possible for them to be very different and that I would like them to be together. I was really hoping that the story would have been longer and I think that is the case and I am glad that I did. I was also hoping that there would be more depth to the book. I really enjoyed reading this book and I'm happy I read it. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. I really enjoyed this book. It is a very good read and I have read the entire series.,0

"I have the original game which I love and I thought that I'd buy the other continents for 2 reasons:
1.  others collect all the games so there must be some reason to want more of basically the same game.
2.  I wanted to use it to help my son learn the main places in africa (we used the original one to learn where main towns in the US/Canada were)
and my opinion?
re: reason #1...There is one added dimension, which is fun, and of course a different map that has a lot of cities that I'm unfamiliar with so it really twisted my brain, which is good, I guess.  But overall, I'm not sick of the first game enough to really need a second similar one yet.  If I was in the mood for ticket to ride, I would have just as happily played the first one....
re: reason #2...Although my son over time might become more familiar with some important cities in africa over time and have a basic idea where they would be, I feel that knowing which country they are in is very important and the lines showing the different countries are not there.  Also, many of the cities are ones that I don't feel he NEEDS to know, and finally, it's only the bottom half of the continent.

end opinion: I like the game but wish that I would not have spent so much money on a game that didn't really fulfill my needs.  I wish that it was all of africa, with countries identified, and only the most widely known cities in all of africa.",1

"Benedict and Yeager describe a vast array of criminal patterns of dozens  of current and former NFL players -- including some hideous and barbaric  acts for which certain players suffered far too little (if any!) jail time.  Because of the variety and brutality of the crimes described, more than  the quality of the writing itself, the book is riveting reading; although  there is a strongly sensationalistic, tabloid-style undercurrent to the  whole piece which may repulse more careful readers.  I finished this book  with three outstanding impressions:
1) Far too little attention is given  to the successful redemption of specific players who have stopped their  criminal ways and become solid, admirable citizens (e.g.,  ""Hollywood"" Henderson or Cris Carter);
2) The writes make a  convincing argument that the pampering which star players recieve in late  childhood immunizes them (in their minds) from consequences for their  actions; and
3) The authors clearly intended to be shocking at least as  much for their own fame and fortune as for any noble social reform.  After  all, these criminal records are public, and were already well documented in  the popular sports media.

Serious football fans and sociologists alike  should read this book to learn of a surprisingly sinister element that is  liberally sprinkled among Sunday's heroes.  But while reading, cast a  healthy dose of skepticism at the intent of the writers.",1

"*SPOILERS*  A decent horror film. The only problem is that it's kind of a slow-paced story. The film is mostly a horror film, but if you're a fan of horror movies, this one is a good one to watch.

They are held for months in the house and then are sent to a juvenile detention center. This is where the children's story begins.

"This is the final book in the Vatta's War Series.

Overall this is solid sci-fi action. Nothing exceptional, just fine. It would probably be hard to follow if I hadn't read the previous books, but all the characters are growing nicely into their roles, and the plot rolls along to a satisfying conclusion. It's a quick read, and I enjoyed it fine.

Except for one thing.

The very end is just terrible. The end of the plot about a pirate fleet taking over systems and disrupting communication is fine, obvious, but fine. But after that ends, the book goes on to give a tag about the end of the romantic tension between two of the lead characters. It's a terrible scene. I mean, it's short, but just ridiculous. Not funny, not romantic: I was embarrassed on the characters' behalf. The romance isn't built up in a way that should lead to a scene that is so juvenile. For another character, in another plot, sure, whatever, it's corny but might be okay.

For this it just left me with a bad taste in my mouth about the whole book.",1

"After 5 novels hasn't Mr. Moody learned that you just, can't, put, a comma, wherever you want to? And at times, well, a comma is needed. This could be credited to extreme sloppiness and mistakes that editors should notice right away. Like the fact that California is 9, not 8 hours behind Amsterdam. Consecutive chapter headings of Wednesday the 10th and Thursday the 12th (with a mention of Friday the 13th) make me wonder what happened to the 11th day of that month. Mr Baker is referred to as ""Mrs"" Baker. (What the hell do editors do these days?) And there are probably others that my quick reading or fading memory have missed.
If  you have a craving for some Chet Baker (who doesn't/shouldn't?) I would suggest de Valk's bio, or pre-order Gavin's. If you have mystery fix, just buy Elmore Leonard. I am not familiar with the other works of Mr Moody, I like the idea of jazz mysteries but heavily shy away from silly clichs and most of all bad writing. If anything I hope this will turn a few people on to the lovely music of Chet Baker.",1

"Let me start off with the packaging.
1. It doesn't say ""Plus"" anywhere on it.
2. The information on the back isn't always correct. It says it has a mini-usb for example when it really has a micro-usb.
3. The packaging looks like something you'd get in a airport vending machine. Not very high end at all.

What is more important is the product itself.
1. It's much lighter than expected. It's a good thing for headphones, but it does make it feel unsubstantial. The diameter is about the size of a silver dollar.
2. The shiny black plastic looks like it will damage easy.
3. The logo in the middle looks like it should be a button. It isn't.
4. The front buttons are easy to access, but the volume buttons on the side are harder to feel.
5. The blue light flashes when it's powered on.
6. It stores in a very small spiral that can be like a puzzle to unravel until you get used to it.
7. Overall it is very comfortable and easy to forget you are wearing. Doesn't fall off easily.
8. USB port is covered by a little rubber flap that isn't very reassuring.

Most important is performance.
1. Bass is underwhelming. Sound is on the tiny side.
2. Connection strength is very good. Easy to walk around the house and not lose connection.
3, You can still easily hear the world around you at normal volumes.
4. Battery lasts as long as advertised and charges quickly.
5. You can still hear the trademark ""bluetooth buzz"" when the sound is low.
6. Microphone isn't very good at hearing you. Constantly had to talk louder than I would have with a phone.

Overall I feel like it is a solid product for the price. Will it win awards in... anything? Probably not, but it is still a great value. I feel it would be a five-star product at $30-35, but at $50 it's still a solid option for small, over-ear bluetooth headphones. The main downside is you can find unbranded versions of these headphones for ~$20 on Amazon, still with Prime shipping.",1

"I couldn't finish. It was painfully one-dimensional to me: the reader was told how to feel about every character and situation from the beginning (I tried to let it slide, because beginnings can be rocky even with great stories).
Fav part was when the Hero was talking to an evil henchman, and he yells, ""How much are they paying you?"" And the henchman replies some amount that means nothing to me, and the Hero says, ""It's not enough,"" and flies into a confident, low-stakes martial-arts butt-kicking, somehow never revealing his face. It might actually be cooler and more believable the way I described it. So cheesy!
Then I got bored: erotic dreams of characters who have no emotional attachment to each other doesn't interest me at all, especially because I'm not attached to either of these characters. I was rolling my eyes about their lusty waking inner-monologues, too. And then our Hero was thinking about masturbating on and off for three pages and there's no chance of this ever feeling romantic to me. Might as well tell me his tragic backstory of bowel movements.",1

My daughter just turned 7 so this game was a little too easy for her, but she still loves it.  This InnoTab game allows children to choose easy or difficult levels.

Behind the doors are the classes where games are played such as matching game, art class and find the missing pieces.

I have not used it for a long time but it looks great in my tool box.  I would recommend this saw for anyone looking for a good quality saw.

Update:  I have now replaced the blades with the new blades.  The saw has a nice finish and I like the look of the saw.  The blade looks very solid and the blade tips are very sharp.  The saw is a bit large for my purposes but I think it is a good quality saw and I would",0

I called Customer Service, and explained the problem, and, within 10 minutes, the helpful representative on the line had agreed that it shouldn't do that, and that they would send me a new unit, along with a prepaid shipping label with which to ship back the damaged unit and that it should arrive in 3-5 days.

 Hume could go two ways: forgive or become a man of vengence.  Which way to go????

"I really tried to like this series. I've read, well quickly skimmed through all the books so far. I won't continue to read anymore. I really felt the story as a whole was just incredibly boring and instead of smart, courageous women we get bratty, careless teenage girls trying to rebel. The dialogue did not reflect adult conversations at all. Plus all 3 books are boring, the thing is these could really be great stories if some effort was put into it. Oh, and they are all in serious need of some quality editing. The poor editing just made the stories even worse. The potential is there for a good action packed sci fi romance but I think the author needs to write adult women into the roles not teen girls...and they're crappy teen girls at that. I've given this author 3 tries, I won't read anything from her again.",1

"Archangel Zach is a quick paranormal read that I found to be interesting and enjoyable.  The plot is solid and the writing is strong and descriptive.  The author has created an engaging world where there are human angels on earth with special powers as well as the Archangels from the Angelic Realm.  These are not supposed to mix in a relationship, but you know what happens when something's forbidden...

Zach's character is tormented and has never gotten past losing his love over three hundred years ago.  It is easy to empathize with him, and to understand why he keeps Shasa at arms length.  I did have a difficult time seeing the two of them together, for some reason they just did not click for me...I just didn't feel that spark between them, I'm not sure exactly why.

The story itself moves well, the second half quicker than the first mostly due to the action and drama that is occurring at that point.  I was able to read this in less than a day, and found the story easy to follow even though I haven't read anything else from this series yet.

If you're a fan of angel books, especially when they mix with humans, this is a good story for you.  Recommended for 18+ due to some language and adult sexual scenes.",1

The transmitting wire is on the outside which gives it a stronger signal even though it runs off the Ipods power. The only drawback is that....it runs off the Ipods power and drains it after a good day of driving, unless you plug it in to a mini USB port cigarette lighter power thingy which you can grab at radio shack. I had to buy another one because I pulled the wire out of it not realizing it was the transmitter cable......not my brightest moment. But just press play and within 4-5 feet of my radio I had crystal clear music with NO STATIC. I could pass it around my car without interruption and people could play what they liked. Excellent product, don't tear the transmitting wire out!",1

I can empathize And true to the case that very few of us imigrants still hold on to hope that the situation in Mexico will improve for the better. It must.

The one thing that kept me from rating this book better was the constant use of translating the 'Mexicanisms' everywhere it is used. Even some that were translated already chapters before. It felt like the author was looking for wordcount buildup. The flow of the story is constantly interrupted by the translated repetitions. Like a street with too many unecessary speed humps you eventually would avoid, I stopped reading halfway through. But I do intend to pick it up down the line to finish the read.

"Plot - Rotten Tomatoes
A bunch of adults discover just how frightening the wrong kind of clown can be in this horror opus. After the girl he loves is stolen away by a thuggish gang member, a young man uses the forces of evil to bring to life Killjoy (Angel Vargas), a clown doll he owned as a child. The young man is killed before the spell can fully take effect, but Killjoy soon comes to life to wreak a horrible revenge on the people who killed his master.

Review - 2/5
When I seen how low IMDB had Killjoy rated I just had to watch it. Was it really that terrible? Well I've seen much, much worse. Yeah the characters are bad and the whole cast is virtually unknown. The camera work is amateurish and cheap. But it does have it's moments that made me laugh at times. The evil clown seems like Micheal Jackson dressed up in a costume. He has some funny one liners and would have been scarier if not for the corny script. The effects aren't the greatest but for how cheaply it was made for they do ok. This film pretty much destroyed the chance of any of the actors or director ever becoming a big name. None of them has made anything of note since. Some of them haven't even acted since. Sorry but this clown in the hood type film just didn't work. It's funny for a one time watch but that's about it. I am relectant to watch the other Killjoy films but I'm sure it can't get any worse. Oh yeah, some hot black girls show some skin at least ;).",1

I love the color, the size, the quality.  It has a very nice shape and the weight is perfect for my needs.

"When it comes to B-movies, Bloodsucking Freaks is ranked right up there with the best of them. What more could you want from a film? It has sex, violence, lots of nudity, and a crazed afro-wearing midget. Don't let the title fool you though. This movie has nothing to do with vampires, in fact except for one great scene, there really isn't much bloodsucking at all. The scene I speak of is the 'doctor' and his 'operation'. A beautiful nude blonde is strapped to a chair. First the doc pulls all her teeth out with a pair of pliers (this is to ensure she doesn't bite). Then he shaves the top of her head, drills a hole through the center of her skull, inserts a tube and sucks out the blood and gray matter. Fascinating.

There are so many scenes in this movie it is difficult to describe them all. The spanking guillotine scene is a favorite of mine, espescially what the midget does with the head after he takes it out of the basket. The midget is one weird little dude, he has a craving for human eyes, always wins at backgammon (another great scene) and is a hell of a little cymbal player.

The plot for this flick is pretty simple. A weird dude operates an S&M torture show in New York. This is a front for his white slavery business. When he's not performing with his cast, he simply tortures whoever is available. He has a cage of cannibalistic wenches that he keeps locked up too. They are good for disposing of any unwanted snoops.

Even the cop who finally busts him gets eaten. There are no winners here, good guys and bad guys die alike. Well the cannibal women do get free and eat their master, so I guess that's good. The final scene before the 'THE END' pops up is hilarious. You'll never eat a hot dog again without thinking of 'Bloodsucking Freaks'.

So enjoy this movie for what it is. I do.",1

We've had this product for about a year now, and I'm still really happy with it.  It's definitely full from my dog, but we have not had any overflow issues.  I'm just about out of the powder that comes with the unit, so I'll need to get some more.  Otherwise, it's been a really convenient product to have.

I would suggest that you seriously dig the depth hole that they recommend in the instructions.  The deeper the better though as sometimes the dog poop will fall down in the hole when you flush the unit with water.

In all honesty, I was a bit pessimistic when I first got this thing a few months ago, but I was desperate enough to buy it.  Thankfully I did, as it's been a great addition to our household and in keeping out yard (and garbage) clean.

The unit is real easy to install.  Just dig a hole, shove it in, fill it up with water and the enzyme they give you, and you're off.  I am lazy with the unit, and normally just pick up our dogs (we just have one) poop on the weekend, and then every month flush the unit with 5-gallons of water and add more enzyme.  The thing seems to really be working.  We have dog play dates regularly, and the unit seems to be able to handle it.  Also, we're currently reaching 20 degree nights and 40 degree day here in Seattle, and it seems to still be working.

While this thing holds a lot of poop, I'm pleasantly surprised that there is not a horrible stench (sure it has a slight poo smell, but it's not gagging).  Definitely would recommend this unit to others who want to dispose of their dogs waste in their backyard.",1

I was able to cut down the number of times I wanted to cut a steak in this knife.  I'm not a big fan of sharp knives, but this is a good knife for a lot of uses.  I like that it has a very sharp handle and that it is made of stainless steel.  I was very impressed with the fact that the blade is not a bit more expensive than a regular knife.  I would recommend this knife for anyone wanting to sharpen their knives and not have to worry about their knives",0

"As an avid cube puzzle lover who has owned many cubes in his 10+ years of cubing, I have to say that this 4x4x4 is amazing. This cube turns very quickly, smoothly, allows easy corner cutting, and overall feels really comfortable in your hands. It has the same color scheme as the original Rubik's brand 4x4x4 (although the Moyu orange is a slightly different shade) so it is a very easy transition from a Rubik's brand cube. I don't feel like I have to worry about pieces popping out with the Moyu cubes, even when turning the sides very quickly, something that often happens with the Rubik's brand cube. I highly recommend this cube to anyone looking to get a 4x4x4.",1

The story starts out with Colt and two friends, Nick and Riley. Nick is the head of the sports team and Riley is the assistant coach. Nick is a strong, determined man. This is a fun story.

I loved the way the story went about getting Colt to be a good husband. I liked how he ended up with his kids. I enjoyed the way it ended. I really liked the way it ended. I'm glad I did.

"Received the item well packaged and very fast. Took about twenty minutes for assembly. All the necessary tools are provided. The assembly steps are more or less intuitive so hardly necessary to read the instructions. The construction is quite good. The machinery fit and finish are almost top notch, but at this price one can hardly complain. The bike works well, will see on durability, but so far very good. After three years, this still works like when it was new. Excellent Value!

Four stars instead of five is largely due to screen, which is somewhat difficult to read. In this day and age of widely available LED readouts, one could have expected this to have a more readable lit screen, instead of LCD. Also, the mini fan is not very functional, but cute nonetheless. But I actually sometimes use the little fan feature as background noise so I can concentrate on my workout better.

Overall, Schwinn did a very good quality job with this bike and as usual, Amazon delivers to us in the most efficient ways. Thanks.",1

"""Playing Dead"" is a thrilling novel from beginning to end. Julia Heaberlin is a gifted writer and the novel's protagonist, Tommie McCloud is a little firecracker to say the least. Tommie is grieving the death of her beloved father as the story opens. But one day, she receives a letter in the mail saying her whole childhood could be a total lie. This is one of those books where it's impossible to explain the entire premise but I might say,  I did feel like ""Playing Dead"" had some plot holes. But even with those plot holes, I enjoyed reading this book. It was fun, entertaining, and the ending was expected. I highly recommend it.",1

"I purchased this and the Forever Litter Tray at the same time, so I can't say much about the costliness of buying new trays every time. I use Just the Crystals instead of the name-brand stuff. With my one cat (female, average to small sized), I can easily go two weeks without touching the box and not have odor issues. I could probably get a bit more usage out of it if I mixed the litter more often instead of never, but I tend to want to be near it as little as possible.

This box has huge benefits for me. I only have to think about litter around every two weeks, there are far fewer litter granules tracked around my house and they're less dusty. My one gripe so far is that it takes up quite a bit of room, though it's far less conspicuous than a litter robot.

My cat took to it fairly quickly. I'm not sure if it helped, but I put a little bit of her old litter brand under the crystals the first time I set it up. I haven't had trouble getting her to change brands in the past.",1

I can tell you this shirt was huge. Pretty much a XXL. The picture shows the shirt being slim through the body but once i put it on there was lots of sleeve room and I had to bunch up, or fold over, the back of the shirt to make it look like the picture. The collar has some smaller, plastic- diamond studs to hold the collar down and the buttons are nice. I like the color of the shirt and the material was somewhat papery but I'm sure with a wash or two it would have been a softer material. I am to sure how the whole process of making and moving these shirts go, but I guarantee that the shirt I wore was not of the ""smaller fit"" batch some people are getting.",1

"This documentary presents a chilling account of the horrors of war (WWII and Vietnam) and a superb insight into the lessons learned from these wars. It talks about the mindset of war and aggression and how that war crimes are just part of that mindset. Killing hordes of enemy civilians doesn't seem to be a bad idea in the grander picture of things. It seems like we never learn from our mistakes. With nukes scattered across the globe, our learning-from-mistakes curve has been reduced to a single dot; make a mistake and you won't live to learn from it.",1
"I can't say enough about this dress!  It is very simple but perfect in all the ways. I am 5'3 and 140 with a 40D bust and normally wear a L but went with the XL because I saw mixed reviews on how it fit. A L would have fit  fine but the XL works too as this is meant to be loose and drape. This fits perfect in the bust with a nice V neckline. The straps are adjustable and the comes up to the armpits so you don't have to worry about you bra showing and if you have a little extra chunk where your chest and armpit meet, this covers it nicely. this is very flowy and has a beautiful irregular hemline. The drape effect comes from extra material on the sides so if you spread it out it looks like batwings. The material is soft and stretchy, but you won't need any extra stretch. It is tapered just right to show off your curves and flatters any shape.  The shortest parts comes just above my knees and longest just below. I would recommend a lint roller. I will be purchasing more in other colors. Perfect for a hot day when you want to be cool, stylish, and comfortable and all for the right price!

"My wife and I have an historic condo in a circa 1890's building - a truly lovely period place with high ceilings, wide moldings, huge pocket doors, marble fireplaces, wood floors, etc.  it cries out for period-piece furniture and ""atmosphere"" consistent with it's heritage.  We both love candles, but they have their drawbacks, from real flames in an older buidling (not a good combination) to dripping, wick-cleaning, etc.  Nevertheless, they are worth the effort.  When saw these I had to have them.  First, they look EXACTLY like real wax candles - and even kind of feel ""waxy"" (although they are not made of wax). And the electric ""candle"" light is authentic - and can be adjusted from just ""on"" to a ""flickering"" real candle effect.  And, best of all, you get a small remote control that you can use to turn them on, turn them off, and set an automatic timer to keep them on for 4 hours, 8 hours, or 24 hours, after which they will turn off.  They run on inexpensive batteries, which last forever, and put out zero heat - no fire hazard.  And, the look and light and flicking is incredible.  The only thing you don't get is a scent - but then again there are other ways to get that besides candles.  We love them, and the price is great.  Highly recommend.",1

She's a little disappointed in the sound quality, but for the price, it's worth it.I bought this as a replacement for my old Sony A-100 on Amazon for $250.00.  It works perfectly and seems to last for quite a while.  I would recommend this product for anyone looking to upgrade their old Sony A-100 to a better product.  I have a Sony A-100 in my home that does not have a built in speaker.  I am not sure why I would give this a bad rating.

"Boss Monster is a light card game for 2-4 players, that takes about 30 minutes (give or take depending on experience and number of players).

In this game, each player takes control of a boss from an 8-bit video game RPG. You must build a fiendish and deadly dungeon, and lure heroes into it with the kind of loot that they like, in order to brutally murder them. You use Room cards to build the dungeon, and Spell cards to aid you (or hinder your opponents). If your dungeon is strong enough, you will kill the heroes and collect them as ""souls"" (points). If the dungeon is too weak, the heroes will break through and wound you. Any boss who takes five wounds is killed and out of the game. But the first boss to survive and gain ten souls is the winner.

This is a solid, fast-paced card game. The theme is fantastic and I love the look of the cards. In fact, everything about the game just screams ""fun"" at first glance, right down to the parody art of famous video games and other pop culture figures. In fact, why the game succeeds is because the theme is tied so strongly to the mechanics, and they blend well, even though it's a very simple game.

It does have some faults. The rulebook could use some work and does not clarify certain basic rules. There's also something of a runaway leader problem (in our game of four, two of us were WAY ahead of the pack by an early point of the game). It's also a game that is already starved for expansions...replay value is questionable.

However, the game itself is very enjoyable for now, and I plan on playing it much more. Kudos to the Brothers for their successful Kickstarter, which amounted to a fine game.",1
"I have to blame myself. I knew when I first looked at it after my girlfriend ordered it - not as secure as our existing harness. Dog can't slip out by pulling forward, but if he freaks out and spins and pulls backward, it could happen. I KNEW it could happen.

It did happen - in the middle of Hollywood.

He was freaked out by a noise, was spinning in circles, slipped out and ran away - ran around a huge block, me in futile pursuit (he runs like a greyhound,) crossed 2 busy streets twice (Yucca and Wilcox) and almost went to Hollywood Blvd. Somehow he survived and this story has a true Hollywood ending... apparently a taxi driver had just let out a fare and my little guy jumped in - only way he could've gone in was on his own. Driver waved me up the street, ""He's here!"" Pointed to his yellow mini-van/taxi. I thought he meant he was hiding underneath - no, he was locked in the back seat.

I had 2 large dogs for over a decade, always had them on either a choker or a secure harness, to avoid my greatest fear of them getting loose. Never happened, they both passed away recently within 6 months of each other. Found this little guy in between, almost lost him because of this harness. Yes - it was on snug. It's not a secure design. Look at it!

Thanks to that taxi driver, I now believe in miracles, but I have zero faith in this harness and am throwing it away when I get home - no matter what my girlfriend says.",1

"3 months ago the case looked very luxury and looked like a case that would hold up. It hasn't completely fallen apart but there are two problems with it so far.

1. the magnets do not stay in their spot, as if the glue used isn't strong enough. Because of that the magnet moves and sets in between the leatherette.

2. the leatherette is separated because of the magnets. Also on other corners it is separating as well.

Overall I like the case and hope it doesnt fall apart completely anytime soon.

Update (June 15, 2013):

The Magnet at the top has officially feel out of the case. This iPad is used for mixed business and pleasure so it is not really used all the time. I'm the only one that uses it. But from constant opening of the case, it pulls the magnets up, therefore tearing the leatherette more and more. The bottom magnet doesnt stay in the original hole anymore and is pushing its way through the leatherette and plastic. The top you can easily peel back and put the magnet back in place but it comes right back out anyways. Its very frustrating being that the rest of the case is holding up well.",1

"Best locking clutch i've encountered. The price deterred me from purchasing one of these for about a year, particularly since the non-locking clutches are noticeably cheaper.

Prior to this I had the Toyota non-locking clutch designed to mount to the bedrail cleat and it was horrible and i'd always worry about my bike flying out of my truck on the highway; but that worry is now gone with this clutch. My only ctitique is this particular one doesnt come with the hardware you need to secure it in your bedrails (which i didn't realize at the time of purchase) so be sure to purchase one with the hardware unless you feel like fabbing up your own. Although solid, the price is still a lot for a locking clutch, especially if you want to purchase two to transport multiple bikes, which why i'm giving it four stars.",1

"This is such a cute little fake guitar.  It is push button rather than anything with real strings.  You play it by pushing the button where you would normally strum the guitar and you do ""fret"" work by pushing down on the interior of the fret section of the guitar.  There is a flip section that alternates the music between electric and acoustic.

My grandson is almost 18 months old and doesn't really know who Dora is as he watches very little on TV (and then only a couple of specific DVDs.)  We do, however, play a lot of instruments amongst the family - just in my house along there are over a dozen different instruments.  He even has a small ukelele of his own at his house that he plays with.  He grabbed the Dora guitar as soon as I showed it to him and showed him which buttons to push.  He ""played"" guitar all afternoon - carrying it around with him everywhere.  He would stop and start dancing and shaking his head to the tunes or would drop the guitar to clap - and then realize that he had to play it again to make the music continue.

The final move of the day was when he put it in his pop-up castle (along with his much beloved Fisher-Price piano keyboard) where it will wait until next week when he comes to my house again.  He loved it and played with it for hours.  His smile was so big, I wondered if it hurt his face to keep it up all afternoon. I'll probably pull out one of my guitars and then we can rock out together.

This is a really cute toy guitar and I recommend it highly.  I don't know why it is recommended for 3 years and up.  I don't see any small pieces that could be a hazard and my little guy loved it at 18 months.",1

"I needed some summer workout shorts, and I didn't want to spend a lot of money. I've never been a big fan of the regular Soffee cotton shorts (the length has always been off on me), but I gave these a shot based on all the good reviews.

I have to say, overall, I'm very pleased. I'm 5'2, with a little bit of a butt, and about a 37"" hip.  These fit alright in the medium, but I could've gone with the smalls probably (I just ordered a pair of small, will update when they come in).  The mediums are a little loose in the leg and in the waist.  I like the cut on these a lot- angled in toward the crotch so the outside of the leg is higher than the crotch, and a shade longer on the back than in the front.  It's a flattering cut that's nice and airy without showing everything.  The waistband is nice and comfortable, you can roll these but you don't have to.

The only reason they didn't get full 5 stars is the lining is pretty thin; I wouldn't buy them in lighter colors, especially not white.  I got black ones and they're fine, but lighter colors would probably show any colored underwear.  I'll be working out in these all summer, and probably lounging around the house in them too.  Like I said, I ordered a second pair, and if those fit, I might order yet more in the smaller size.

Edit: I like the smalls better.  For a 36-37"" hip, a small is a good fit; they stay up easier than the mediums still without giving a muffin top effect, and they're no more sheer than the larger size.  I wear the smalls to the gym now and wear the mediums around the house.",1
"Another top quality product by SKLZ.

I'm using the lateral resistor to train my 8 year old son in speed/agility/quickness. I can also use it myself. The cuffs for the ankles are comfortable and fit children and adults of all sizes. they fasten together with strong velcro that doesn't separate when the product is being used.

The resistance band in between the velcro cuffs gives you resistance whether you're shuffling laterally or taking big steps forward, backward, or diagonally.

This product doesn't come with its own case, but that doesn't matter because it's small enough to pack with whatever else you're using during speed training.

It comes with a two sided poster and a DVD. The DVD gives you a very good demonstration of several Lateral Resistor moves (in addition to the exercises you can do with other SKLZ products), and the poster gives you a six week program showing you when to perform these moves. One side of the poster is a workout program for the Lateral Resistor. On the other side is a workout program for the resistor plus many of the other SKLZ products.

"Ditching David is terrific mystery with strong characters. I really wonder what it next for Gina?  I hope Mendoza and Diane will be part of the continuing series.  Jenna Bennett is an outstanding writing and she proves it once again with this first book in a new series, Fidelity Investigations.
Gina Kelly thinks that realizing that her husband might have tricked her out of getting any money in their pending divorce is the worst thing that could ever happen to her; least that is was she thinks until he is murdered and she becomes the prime suspect.  Gina is not an investigator, but she has already been following her cheating spouse and that woman with great success for all the good it did.  Now she turns her attention to figuring out who could have killed the jerk and tried to frame her.  After all she is the most obvious suspect and she knows she didn't do it.",1

"I just received this item today. At first glance, it looks attractive enough. Upon closer inspection, it is a poorly made item. The manufacturers should have put more thought in quality rather than adding two decorative silver bones which adds no function to this item. The stitching is unraveling at the ""leash area."" The ""tag"" stitching also has unraveled. If I were the cynical type, I would say that the supplier knew of the unraveled stitching and tried to glue it back together but it didn't hold. Also the hidden tag is paper under a plastic sleeve. I would never trust my beloved dog to only have this as a tag. It is not waterproof nor is it secure in it's sleeve; The tag is useless. The ""D"" is too bulky, and as others have mention, the extra collar end just hangs there, making the collar look unfinished and shabby. The built-in leash is a great idea, but this item falls short in quality. The leash is made of some stretching rubber (kind of like a car fan belt but not as strong). I predict that this leash will break if used too often, so I am not going to rely on it in public. I'll just use it in the house. I normally would return a product like this but it probably would cost me more in time and money to ship it back, which is probably what the supplier counts on. Buyers, read the reviews carefully, cause the reviews I read were right on. I'll use it for six months, which it what I give it before it's none usable. For now I will keep looking for a similar product but with better workmanship. Fail.",1

I always love a heroine that is strong and vulnerably honest at the same time. Shadow, the ultimate hot, broody, bad boy who is broken....I am however a bit of a Lincoln fan, will be interesting to see his character evolve more.

"Worth every penny.  This product will pay for it's self many times over.  Just the cost of going to the range, ammo and time.  Not to mention the muscle memory that can be achieved by the regular practice of this system.  Very high quality.  Don't let the plastic fool you.  I have a Glock 43 and this practice pistol fits on top of the real pistol perfectly.  The weight is very close.  Not having lead bullets in it makes it slightly lighter but the grip, sights and similar weight is about the same as dry fire practice with the real pistol.  The big advantage is that the laser lets you see exactly where your shot is at.  I practice around my bedroom at night when I get home from work.  While my wife sleeps and my skill has improved in a very short time.  I can hit the closet door hinges, center of the door handle, item in the master bath you name it dead on.  It allows me to work on my grip, form and aim with out disturbing anyone or any thing.  Think of the money I am saving.

"The first in the series, an island with a distinct history of history that makes the island one of the most interesting places in the world.  The island itself is a great place to read, and it is not in the same league as the rest of the Island.  The island is mostly a desolate place with a few small islands, but the island itself is a beautiful place.  It is quite a wonderland, with many beautiful flowers, trees, and even a few dunes.  There is a number of interesting places, but most of them are actually not so interesting.  There are also some places that are absolutely beautiful, but most of them are not.  The only place that is completely beautiful is the island of Mok, where the story is told.  There are several islands, and the island of Mok is one of them.  In addition to the island of Mok, there are some islands where the author creates a whole story that is not very interesting, and this is one of the islands where the author creates the most interesting characters.

"Mr. Carroll has written an interesting book.  I read this book in a matter of days, a sure sign it never got boring. I disagreed with Mr. Carroll constantly, but still give the book a  high rating.  I came away from the book finding Mr. Carroll to be phony. A man rebelling against an overbearing father by entering the Priesthood, a vocation he was completely unfit for. He showed no respect for his vocation at the seminary where he and his fellow seminarians cursed their directors and teachers. He was ordained and became a professional protester, I don't recall him performing many priestly duties, but he sure did a lot of protesting against the Vietnam War. He did seem to realize he wasn't Priestly material soon after the war ended. I find it amazing how many seminarians and young Priests seemed to lose their Priestly vocation after the war ended and they were in no danger of being drafted.  I did find his father to be overbearing and abrasive at times, but it always seemed that his father was the one reaching out to reconcile with his son. Mr. Carroll is always right and dear ole dad is always wrong, I think he should have evaluated himself and looked more closely at his father's points of view before writing this book. It must feel good knowing you have never been wrong.",1

I received this book free from the publisher through NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. This book was a total shocker. It's very sad that this book is out of print. The author, William F.

"Wow Allie Juliette Mousseau has done an amazing job again. This book can be read as a stand-alone! At times this book brought me to my knees because I could feel the pain of Liam and Quinn. These two have been dealt a s*** hand. The book does flip from past to present a little more than my liking but you do need the back history for their story to make sense.

Quinn is a kid that has a mother who doesn't want her, she throws her out at 15. She has to learn how to survive on the streets. Being a 15 year old young lady on the streets is dangerous. And living in the wrong part of town you only have a few options in survival, drugs to numb the pain or selling yourself to devil to have some money. She makes her choice and it is neither. She meets Liam and he is living the same life. No parents, the abuse can be to much when you go from foster home to foster home. Liam learns to fight to survive. And when he meets Quinn he fights enough for both of them. That is so much for anyone to handle but they both do they best they can with what they have. Now go forward 10 years, their demons are still with them. They carry them everyday but Quinn did what anyone at young age would do when her world crashes, she ran as far away as possible leaving Liam behind. Liam did what he did and does best he fights. MMA fighting. But what brings Quinn home brings them face to face again. The question is, is it to little to late or will they save each other once and for all?

"My three daughters ages 11, 9 and 6 all wear TuffRider Jods. They wear extremely well and are color fast. Not to mention dirt, and grass stains have come out easily. The grips on the inside of the legs work well and keep some tackiness which is great when they train jumping, dressage or are just practicing holding their post.
We have 4 pair of sand and 2 pair of the black in TuffRiders. I liked the sand as it's a shade darker than the tan and looks better while still not getting too hot in the Florida sun. The cotton spandex blend is well done and my 11 year old has already handed down her jods to her younger sister and you can't tell. Just don't let stains sit for over a day as they will most likely still come out but not without much longer soaking and/or scrubbing for stable mystery stains. Good luck.",1

"The original book may do a better job, but this HBO production takes great license with the facts, to strumpet things up for a public who seem to need the violent and naked, or otherwise they turn the channel to something equally brain-dead.  Factually, there is nobody who can document so much of what's presented here as ""fact"" -- such as Hamilton and the Adam's cousin, screaming for blood, with twisted angry faces, as a Tory tax agent is tarred and feathered. One almost expects Walter Cronkite to step out from the crowd with a microphone, as in the old ""You Are There"" series.  It also appears to be a conscious effort to show the early American revolutionaries were no different from modern anti-global thugs throwing bricks through MacDonald's and Starbuck's windows, and carrying effigies of modern political leaders hanging from ropes while waving the Red Fascist flags.  The legitimacy of early American sentiments for freedom and self-government is thereby eroded and belittled, while modern fanatics are elevated inappropriately.  Or the ""small"" fact that two of the British soldiers at the Boston massacre actually were convicted, and one of them admitted to his lawyer that he was the one who shouted ""Fire"" (while discharging his weapon), and not one of the street mob. The erasure and clever distortion of those kinds of facts is exactly how a trained propagandists works, not to make big obvious lies, but to cleverly skew things in a particular direction, and also to highlight the rare event (ie, the tarring-and-feathering) to make it seem equal to common events (heavy-handed British thuggery against the population of the Americas) which are down-played, or not even mentioned!  With those kinds of factual distortions, how can any of it be trusted?  It cannot!  Oh well, that's modern film-making for you -- where directors and writers confuse their own aspirations for social change and ""influencing the masses"" with authentic telling of history.  Advice: stick to authentic documentaries, and keep fresh batteries in your BS detector.",1

"Really a neat bag to carry all kinds of stuff. It is totally soft sided & collapsible-also alot roomier than you'd expect. However, the bottom is also just soft canvas & if you're carrying a netbook/laptop you will need to protect them by adding padding to the bottom or carrying them in some other casing. Also the center compartment is not stitched to the bottom, so anything in those two compartments will travel around the bottom of the bag. I think that area was designed as a holder for paperwork, but you can reinforce it by just stitching it down to the bottom seam. I really liked the bag so I added some stiff padding to the bottom to protect my netbook and give the bag a little sturdier footing for when it's set down vs. just letting everything flop around the bottom of the bag. All things considered, for the price-it's a keeper. Looks durable,very roomy, easy to store & just a neat bag to have.",1

It does what it is supposed to do. I am a little concerned in the packaging of the product as it appeared to have been opened. There were the included cables still in plastic so I am not sure if this was box was just opened or it was a used product repackaged. The only other issue is that the polarized plugs really were difficult to plug in. I had to use the blade of a screwdriver to get them all the way flush into the surge protector on the standard size outlet side. No issues on the large outlets for the power adapters.,1
"It's a very pretty bra, and seems to be made out of quality materials, but the underwire is cut too high on the sides so they poke into my underarm. If I adjust the bra so it sits lower, it's too low to offer any kind of support. I would exchange this for another, but I already cut the tags when I realized the underwire problem, so it's too much of an issue to make it worth it.",1
They look good on me and they are comfortable. I think they would look better if I was a little bigger. I am a size 2 but if I was a size 4-6. They would look hot. Im wearing it for a new years party so I can rock it with a really nice cowneck sweater or a sparkling blouse and ankle boots.,1
These are the best.  I have bought many.  Batteries last about 3 months with everyday use.  Good brightness. You will not be disapointed!,1
This was a bit larger than I expected.  The two inch thick plastic is a bit too small for my 8 month old.  I also bought the Tamiya version of this as a gift.  It is a good size for a 2 year old and is still fun for her.  The 2 year old is going to love it.  I think it is a great toy.,0

"I have never written a review before, but this book irritated me.  Entirely too much internal dialogue.  All 6 books leading up to this one were forward moving, action packed, weaving new sub-plots... not this one.  Like other reviewers I grew really tired of Mac and her immaturity (even though she tried to evolve out of it), and such strong emotions being dumped all together.  The emotional roller coaster finally made me motion sick.  I got really tired of the inside of Mac's head.  Dont ""tell"" me how she feels, ""show"" me how she feels.  And frankly, after 27 pages, i really ""don't give a frog.""  Actually, halfway through the last book I really didn't care what happened to anyone.  Not a good sign after 6 books (which I loved).
I think the series went too long, so the amount of backtracking that had to be done to allow for people who are too lazy to start at the beginning got really tiring.  I felt the for-shadowing for Barrows return was heavy handed so I didn't mourn his death at all, I just thought ""You Idiot!  He TOLD you don't expect things to die!"" and then was frustrated that she didn't hang around and defend his body so it wasn't eaten by the locals. If this was someone I cared so much for, and I thought there was the slightest chance he could come back, i would stand there spear in hand until his head rotted off. Highly unbelievable character actions.
I so loved the Highlander series that I was super happy she wove the characters into this one. I was glad to hear from the MacKeltars and Adam and all them.
In all, I felt the story ended too abruptly, slamming on the brakes and throwing me into the dashboard. I leave the series battered, bruised and sorely needing a dramamine.",1

In the past, the thought of dealing with cords and heavy vacuums typically prevailed over my urge to keep things clean, until such a time when everything just became intolerably dusty. However, with this vacuum, cleaning is actually kind of fun.

But what really inspired me to write this review was how awesomely and effectively this thing sucks up and kills bugs. Turn the ""Max"" setting on and no insect or arachnid shall escape its wrath. Suck them up from five feet away, spin them around and they are dead. I love this thing.",1

I thought it was too big for my dog but now she's small enough that it's not too big for her.  I'll definitely buy this one again.  I was going to order another one but now that I have one I can't get her to eat it.  I don't care for it, but it's not a great fit for a small dog.  My dog loves this one.

"I've used several different Hoovers and Eurekas in recent years, so I have some perspective on vacuum cleaners in this price category, both bagged and bagless, and so far, I'm finding the Bissell measures up well.  I didn't think of Bissell as a top vacuum cleaner brand (I think of them as making rug shampooers), but I've been impressed.

PROS:

It has good suction--my first use produced that ""Wow"" when you see how much dirt was in the carpet you thought was pretty clean;

It has multiple filters that are washable, so there are no maintenance costs for bags or filters;

The powered upholstery attachment with spinning beater brush works great--much better than just having a little brush attachment that pushes the hair around;

It's extremely easy to assemble (one screw);

It's sturdy and solid for the price;

It's not the lightest I've used (that would be the Eureka Lightspeed, which started to fall apart almost immediately), but it's not overly heavy or bulky--it's a good weight;

It's no more noisy than any of the other similarly-priced vacuums I've used;

The extension hose doesn't have to be placed into a hole every time you want to use it and then pulled out afterwards, unlike some other models--it's always attached to the suction, so all you have to do is pull it out and start using it; and

The canister comes off and goes back in very easily--more easily than some I've used--and can be easily emptied.

CONS:

I find little to complain about with this unit, but like all of the other vacuum cleaners I've used, the cord doesn't retract, so you have to always keep it out of the way as you vacuum.  Others have said the cord could be longer; I find it's about average, but sure, a little longer wouldn't hurt (although then there's more to keep out of the way).",1

This was three years ago, and I was sure it was about time to put him down.  He's a little slow going up and down stairs, but he does it on his own now.  He gets up and down on his own and follows me around just like he did when he was a puppy.  He's a happy dog and still as loveable as always.

"The author wrote the perfect amount, drawing me in to the scenes and allowing the reader to feel a strong connection. I just love this author writing, she is one of the most talented authors I have come across, mainly because her writing is so real and original. I have read The Heart Racer series since the beginning, and I love each and every story but WOW, Marian have out done herself on this one!!!The prologue sets the scene perfectly and I found I didn't want to put it down until I got to the end of the book just so I could see how everything worked out for Kalli. Kalli is a bright, strong-will young lady, who been to hell and back. Yuri is a silent, broody with a cold heart and no compassion young man, who is the VP of the Afxisi club until he meets Kalli.

First it seemed to use a lot of juice. I seemed to be putting batteries in it every so often. That was not that much of a pain.

I am just not that thrilled with radio. I have seen gone back to the simply little Sony radio that costs about $30 or so. That bad boy is rugged, easy to use and lasts forever on one battery. The Sangean takes two.",1

"I recently saw this movie on television and knew that it needed to be in my DVD library.  This film is about a bacteriologist (Edward Norton) who very quickly falls in love with a young lady (Naomi Watts), they marry, and he takes her back to China where he's stationed as a English civil servant.  She doesn't really love him when they marry and tells him that, but she looks at marrying him as a way to get out of her home and away from her mother since there aren't any other prospects for her.  In China she gets bored with him and her life there and winds up having an affair with a low level English diplomat.  I won't say any more but suffice it to say that this movie just slowly sucks you in -- the art direction, the photography, the styling -- you feel as if you're in China in the 1930's.  The acting is superb, in my opinion, because it is not-in-your-face.  Rather, it is subtle and there are moments when a glance, or smirk, or a move of the head evokes the feeling vs. words.  Naomi Watts seems perfect for the part of the wife, and Edward Norton plays the repressed, formal English man to perfection.  The supporting cast - especially Toby Jones, are also superb.  Too bad that this movie didn't garner more attention when it came out because it certainly deserves a viewing.  It's a different kind of love story with no violence, no naked bodies, no CGI graphics, no swearing, no car/motorcycle/truck action shots -- that explains why it probably didn't make $300 billion dollars at the box office.  Oh well....",1

Oh my gosh I love Solease Barners The draglen Brothers Series, they are just too darn amazing foreal.  When I finished Gemi I was like oh gosh I need more and more of those darn dragon brothers.  Solease has always kept our attention with each of the draglen brothers each story is always different, and each characters posses their own unique characteristics and dispositions in the book. We are onto the fourth brother who is Gemi. Unlike the other brothers who really weren't searching for a Wella, he has longed for mate to be his other half, the one who is destined to be his.  While in New Orleans he comes across the one person who is his and only his; Shalisi.  Shalisi is not your typical woman, though she is sweet, sexy there is one tiny problem in this possible romance... she is a witch and one of the dragons most mortal enemy. Her destiny is to become a Passer but she must make a difficult decision whether to leave her coven and true calling behind or to be with the dragon who makes her feel, and long for more.  I loved this book oh my gosh im not gonna lie between all of the draglen books this one was by far my most favorite.  Solease wasn't kidding when she said Gemi is far more different from the other brothers in this series and hot damn he was totally amazing for sure.  You have to read the series because each one kind of gives the hint of what's to come in the other upcoming books.",1

I wish it was a bit thicker. The only thing I would change is to order the red one. It's a bit too big for my needs and my grandson will probably be able to fit it on his bed. It's very easy to put it on the wall and I'm sure he will love it.This is a great design.  It has a nice deep blue color that doesn't fade or fade.  It is a great size and I like that it has a shelf.  It is very quiet.  I would recommend it.This is a good little tree.  I have a small tree in my bedroom and this tree stands out.

The magnet is solid and well-made. It holds the magnet securely, but it doesn't hold the magnet in place.

I also like that the magnet has a sharp handle, so I can bend it, so it doesn't slide around the bottom of the magnet.",0

Naturally I take interest in anything that would affect his health, so I decided to read the book myself. The book provides comprehensive, easy to read information on the 10 most beneficial supplements for men and how they can help to get that sexy physique that you desire. What I like most about the book is that it gives a complete overview of the supplements their benefit, uses and precautions. Reading this book will help any man on the quest for a safe and healthy way to build lean muscles by complementing their diet with supplements to achieve their goals. The author goes as far as to telling you which workout programs goes best with the supplements, for example creatine is good for short repetitive workouts as opposed to aerobics. Well written facts on supplements that I know will benefit anyone who wants to increase their knowledge as well as use supplements in a safe and effective way.",1

One thing I really appreciate is that even though it is a part of a series, it very easily stands on its own.  I don't feel the need to read additional books in the series, but I probably will.",1
"This is the first hydration system I have found that doesn't make your water taste like nasty chemicals.

We recently went on a week-long hiking trip in Peru, and I knew I wouldn't want to mix a sugary drink in my bladder to sip on all day, even if it was available.

The only problem I had was that I had to plug in the HDMI port to the bottom of the device and it would not recognize the device.  After I plugged it in, it wouldn't recognize it.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is that it was very easy to hook up the device.  I did get one lucky customer who just plugged in and it recognized it.  I have used it a couple of times and it has never stopped working.

I'm very happy with the product.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants a good computer.This cable works fine for the price and I would recommend it.Works great on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3.This cable is perfect for my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3.

I don't think that's a bad thing.I bought this to use with my Roku and it works great. The quality is good. The colors are good, the picture is good, and the sound is good.

This series just gets better. I love the characters and the history. I would recommend this series. Great job!I liked this book but the writing was a bit slow. The story was a little rushed.

Fortunately they do not go into the intestine, but stay in her stomach until she vomits them up.  Just started using the Trainer by using the ""beep"".  I lay towels around the house and use the ""beep"" and say ""leave it"" and she does not touch the towels.  I even throw the towels in the air and she does not go for them.  Next I will use the ""shock"" to reinforce.  I always use a tiny treat when she responds positively.  Eventually I hope to leave the bathroom doors open and the towels on the rods without her grabbing them.  I highly recommend this system.",1

"I've read this novel twice now, and I can see myself reading it again at some point, thanks in part to prose such as, ""Mortimer favored loud ties, liked his food to the point of fussiness, and bowed and scraped in front of clients in a way that gave the Major his only opportunity, outside of the Sunday Times crossword, to use the word 'oleaginous.'"" There are no huge, cliffhanging surprises here, just very good writing and characters that draw you along and make you wish for the story to never end. I hope Helen Simonson is busy giving us another such well written novel.",1
"THe reviewer who said s/he didn't like Picasso and felt this book was Picasso-esque provided, I think, the most accurate and succinct description of this book. However, unlike the other reviewer, I enjoy Picasso's cubism and expressionistic figures, and I was moved by this book.

I found that it was important to read every word, because if I read to quickly and skipped over words and sometimes sentences, I missed important moments in the book. I had to re-read the last 5 pages to make sense of the ending. Reading every word of a novel can be taxing - and many novels don't warrant a close reading. But this one does.",1
"I initially saw this HBO special movie on HBO. Being a Jersey Girl, myself, I connected with the characters & their life styles.

I'm a big fan of them both. Well worth watching.",1

"I would have liked to have much more interaction between Cade and Cecelia. This book is in the romance section but most of the book was about all the different ops going on in the story. And the note at the bottom of the book description about graphic sex? Maybe I'm just biased based on the other books I've read but the 3 scenes I remember (& I don't count one-liner remembering as a sex scene) were not exactly graphic in my opinion.

All that being said, this was a good military romance read, with lots of twists, turns, violence, intrigue, etc.

This is book 3 in the Deep Six Security series, so you may want to read the other two first. It is not necessary, in my opinion (I have not read them), but may help in understanding where the other characters are coming from in this story.",1

"This is a perfect first time purchase and the materials are good. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very heavy, and the cover is very large. The material is not durable, so it will be hard for most people to find a good one. The bottom line is, it's a great item and a great value. I love this gun. It works well and seems to last for years. I have a Beretta 1270 and it is very light weight. The sights are very well made and easy to sight in. The front sight has a nice metal plate that is very easy to attach and remove. The rear sight is very easy to attach and remove. I also like the color and the grip. It is very comfortable and comfortable. I wish the grip was a little larger for my hands. I would have liked the option to have the grip have the handle side up. I would have liked the end of the grip to be a little larger for my hands. I have been using it for several years and I would have liked the grip to be a little larger for my hands. I would have liked the grip to be a little more comfortable. I have a nice collection of guns and this is a great gun for the money. I highly recommend this product. I love this bag!

"I picked up this book because I'd been wanting to read one of Karen's recent books, Immortal Highlander, but something kept nagging me that I should read one of her earlier books first. I'm glad I did. This was the first book of hers that I read and I LOVED it.

Ms. Moning has a great passion for storytelling. More than once I was tempted to highlight sentences or passages because they were phrased so well. Of course, I was so engrossed in the book that I could not be bothered to put the book down long enough to get a highlighter.

This story is fun to read and is based on supernatural beings called Berserkers which were supposed to have existed in Scotland many years ago. We watch the character of Grimm go through a transformation as he attempts to hide his true nature from the world and then, through circumstance, reveal himself to close friends and to the woman that he loves.

One of the things that I love about Ms. Moning's books is they all have this element of fearing to reveal our true self to the person we love the most, even when that person is the person who understands us best of all. When the moment finally comes to share ourselves, we find that the other person knew the truth and accepted us all along.

I love the scene in the church when Jillian's father says that love involves having passion, so much passion that you'd be willing to kidnap your beloved before she turned to someone else. You really get the sense of divine intervention in this book. This man and this woman are made for one another and no matter what they do to deny it, fate always steps in and thrusts them together until they are ready to accept it.

I highly recommend this book and pretty much anything else by this author. She has a fabulous way of combining celtic mysticism and historical romance without feeling forced.",1
"NUMBER OF HEARTS: 4
Dont ask me why I took so long to read this book because I don't have a reason.  I am in love with Ms. Burtons Hope series and I am so glad that I did finally pick up this novella!!
I really enjoyed Will & Janes journey.  Both are just great.  Even if Jane is stubborn and determined to do it all on her own.  I could tell you everything that happens but what fun would that be.  (hint it wouldnt be any fun).
If you are a Hope fan and you have not read this novella yet?  You should and I think you will enjoy it very much.  If you are new to this series you don't have to start here but I think you should.

The pan is great, a bit tinny so it warps easily but pretty good.  The problem: The rack in NOT Stainles and ""rots.""  See photo.

You can see corrosion from chicken and pork?  See exposed copper which was used as an inter-plating before chrome plating.  Now regular steel wire costs about $1/lb and Stainless Steel costs about $2/lb.  Therefore, for being miserly, by not using good materials two things happen: 1) In ordinary use the plating breaks off meaning you may be ingesting both chrome and copper (ingesting iron won't hurt you, and actually the copper won't either, but I don't really know about chrome.  C'mon Manufactuer spend $1 more and raise the price $2 and give me a pan WITH A RACK that lasts.  The manufacturer says stainless steel pan so is semi-honest and so gets one star.

"I received this book free for review. I am not being compensated or influenced.

I could not put this book down. I devoured it in a matter of an hour and a little bit, and it blew my mind. Devlin is by far one of my favorite male leads of anything Ive read this year. Hes strong, smart, sensitive and tough. Hes been held prisoner for years, but some seriously nasty villains, and despite torture and terrible things happening to him, he remains true to himselfa healer not a fighter. Which just makes me so happy.

Jamie is another great character, she grew on me pretty steadily throughout the novel. I really love their chemistry together, and the fact that the female character was the stronger in the relationship. Devlin is not an alpha malebut it works so well with Jamie who pulls him out of everything and works to make their world better. This is the fourth book in a series, but it didn't feel like I was coming into the story mid-way. Characters from previous books show up and are mentioned but theres enough context to determine who is who without giving away their stories.",1

"Peggy Henderson's Blemished Brides series just keeps getting better and better; In His Arms is my favourite by far. Levi and Grace have both had difficult things to deal with in the past which have left them both reluctant to trust or let anyone get close to them. Thrown together in unusual circumstances, this is the story of two people who find their walls breaking down and that trust and love are possible. In my opinion this book contains Peggy's most beautiful writing to date. The characters are realistic and well-drawn as always. Grace is a determined and stubborn person, despite (or maybe because of) the circumstances that have surrounded her life. She also has a softness to her, and I was on her side right from the beginning. Levi is a self-sufficient but thoroughly sweet and gentlemanly man. I was also very much on his side from the beginning! Together they make the perfect couple, and seeing them happy at the end of the book was extremely satisfying. The supporting characters are great (I won't say more as I don't want to give anything away), and, as usual, the natural world, which Peggy describes so well, is very much in evidence. If I could I would give this book more than 5 stars.",1

What a great book!  I preordered this book and read it as soon as I received it.  I'm glad I did.  It was a wild ride with so many changes.  I can't help but be caught up by the plot and action in the story.  I also have to say the author does an amazing job with her character development and world building.

"December 17th--""$99 for a stuffed animal?""  I'd say that it's a great purchase!  The other two we got were the ones with the bumper, and the ones with the other two.  Both of them were good size, and one was a little too big.  The one with the bumper was a bit smaller than I thought it would be, but I've had the same problem with the other one.  I think the two are the same size, and I'm not sure if that's because I'm smaller than the other, or because it's not just the bumper.  The other one is definitely bigger than the one with the bumper.  It's a fun little toy for little ones to play with.I bought this for my 9 year old daughter for Christmas.

"Koontz in ""The Husband"" reinvented the definition of a quick read. Read first 20 pages and then the last 20 pages and that's pretty much all you'll need to get the most out of this chicanery.

The book's cover describes an ""earth-shattering"" climax. Reviewers talk about a ""hair-raising"" thriller. Did the standards of the book publishing sink so low that anybody who may have previously published something worthy can now pretty much sell mule's crap to the public by slapping a colorful bow on it and labeling it an ""earth-shattering"" droppings?

Yes, the book starts out just as advertised. But then quickly goes down-hill from there. Koontz did not spend enough time on the characteristics of his protagonist Mitch Rafferty and his wife Holly so that readers connect with them and sustain the nerve-racking feeling from beginning to the end. My pulse quickly dropped after first 20 pages. My hair never raised and as I was reading the climax scene there was no earth movement.

I am sure the movie is coming soon too. If this happens then my hair will surely rise to the occasion.",1

I just feel like it's left hanging.

I feel like the dialogue was forced. Some of the things the characters said had me confused. I feel like in some places info was just to be assumed by the reader and not explained. I felt like it jumped around in some places and then in other things were dragged out. Things happened without explaining and I had to reread chapters thinking I missed something.

All in all, it wasn't bad. I love books with babies, I just feel as if I'm left hanging and have no way to fix it.",1

"Judging by the Cover. By Dawn Doyle  4 Stars
The say blood is thicker than water, and family comes before anything. I found out real quick that blood is not thicker than Money. Everything I thought I knew had turned upside down in the blink of an eye. Demi who escapes after witnessing several family members being murdered. She is placed into protective custody  and moved across country. Demi has to keep herself hidden, not recognisable while out and about. So she dresses in goth clothes and dyes her hair. Jordan the guy that lives next door is furious that someone has moved into his best friends house. Demi and Jordan's first meeting did not go well at all. He knows he is being irrational about this but he is too hurt to care about anything but  his own feelings. Even with time they still cannot stand each other. But Jordan senses that there's something different about the goth looking girl. As their friendship develops secrets come to light and they understand each other better. They must prepare to protect themselves to survive. This was a very exciting book with lots of sitting on the edge of your seat biting your nail moments. The banter between Demi and Jordan was hilarious as much as heart warming. Can these two find love before the bad guys find Demi.

"Ignoring common sense and warnings on the Web, I bought one of these hand held Dyson DC34 vacuums for about 4 times what I'd pay for a high end competitor's model (e.g. Black and Decker LiIon model). When I got it, I was initially very pleased: Good suction, worked very well. The battery life is short (maybe 6-7 minutes on a charge), but I knew that going in, and that's just part of the package.

Then, after a number of months, the machine began stopping after a few seconds. It wasn't that the battery wasn't charged: I could use it for a few seconds, have it stop, play games with the unit, get it to run for maybe 20-30 second, have it stop, play more games, and so on to get the full 5-6 minutes out of it. But the unit just failed to run continuously for more than a fraction of a minute. I went online and discovered this is a horribly common problem with this model. I contacted Dyson and had them tell me that the unit was out of its (short) warranty and that I'd need to buy another one.

That's not going to happen. Instead, I'll try to warn you all not to waste your money on this machine that, apparently, has design defects. Instead, get a high end (LiION battery) Black & Decker, or similar model for a quarter of the price. It might not be 100% as good as a vacuum, but it's assuredly 90% as good, and in addition, you'll get a much longer lifetime out of it. And when it dies, you can buy another THREE before you're up to the cost of this piece of poorly designed junk.

Holy crap John Cassian is one dark, twisted amazing author!! When I read his first book Killing Matt Cooper I was a bit unsure at first, but by the end I was floored. After finishing book two I am speechless absolutely speechless. This is an amazing book and Mr. Cassian is a gifted author. I look forward to reading more of his works.

"Who wouldnt want to get into a book with a third person perspective. The premise of the story is that the publisher, a former publisher, is planning to publish a novel by a young author.

The story starts with a young girl sitting in a bar and a man who seems to be an alcoholic.

"I've had this model for several years and was delighted to find a replacement(s) on Amazon.  They are BIG and 2 of them are perfect for our 4 indoor cats.  I remove the flap in front *and* the upper part of the flap on top (needs some muscling to remove the latter).  2/3s of one of the 38lb green plastic containers of litter from CostCo fills it somewhat deeply.  I clean once a day and backfill litter as necessary.  I do not use the locking mechanisms (see removing flaps!).  One plus to this container is that I have a cat that -tho fixed- occasionally likes to pee while semi-standing up (not true spraying).  The back of the bottom pan is higher than the front which really helps.

Forgot - If you have a very large cat, removing the top part of the flap is key....

LATER 2/28/16 - decided to keep the top part for one box as our female cat is shyer .... ALSO .... you will get a teench of leakage if a tall cat stands absolutely upright to pee (maybe I should have kept both top portions?)  I also plan to try a ""top entry"" box for the schnook.",1

"This book is so, so good.  I wish I had known about this series before, but I will definitely being going back to catch up on all the books I have missed.

This book starts off with Vaughn in the hospital, hell bent on finding Lark, who has stolen something that is very precious to him.  It is immediately apparant that these two have a history (which may have been revealed in the other books that I haven't read yet).  Once Vaughn is healed he sets out to find the elusive woman that stole not only property from him, but his heart as well.

Lark is on the run from her past.  No one knows who she truly is and she can't let anyone ever find out or else she is a dead woman.  Running has recently become harder after he last stop.  Not only did she make some really good friends but she went and fell in love as well.  That is how she knew it was time to move on, she promised never to let herself get too attached to anyone ever again.

With the help of his brother and a few close friends Vaughn is able to track lark down.  However, things aren't exactly as they appear and once he finds out who Lark really is there is nothing he won't do to protect the woman he loves and bring her back home where she belongs.

"Issues and/or things to note:
1. Body proportions are all on point except for his head which is kinda small especially in comparison to Cap unless his helmet is supposed to be skin tight LOL
2. Diaphragm/ab and waist points of articulation are pretty loose.
3. More gaps than usual/before in the sculpt to where you can see through a lot of the figure at the points of articulation. (ex: upper and lower neck gaps, tailbone(?) area, and etc.)
4. Weird sculpt/design in some places. Giant, flat knee joints again and quite a few pieces that are sculpted outward on the figure that you should be wary of in case of breaking off like 2 little tabs on the back and the elbows which stick out a lot this time in a pretty ugly way.

Improvements from older Iron Man figures:
1. Body proportions are way better; bulkier as it should be to represent an actual man in a suit.
2. Repulsors on palms are painted this time unlike on the Mark 45.
3. I appreciate the little blue paint lines in each of the mini arc reactors all around the suit because I expected them to all just be plain silver.

Other than those, it's still an overall awesome figure. I suggest you watch AnthonysCustoms review of it on youtube if you want more details.
This Mark 46 is to the Mark 45 as the AOU Cap is to the CW Cap; Lots of similarities in pros And cons. But in the end, this is indeed my favorite Iron Man figure to date and in my opinion I think it's the best one that's been released so far.",1

"J.D. Robb, aka Nora Roberts, does a great job with the In Death series. I've read all of them, some of them multiple times. Her latest effort is somewhat formulistic -- a case long closed suddenly opens up again when a prisoner who she helped to put away escapes and comes looking for her. What makes this different is the link to her mother. I think she missed an opportunity by killing her mother off. I've been wondering about grandparents, aunts, uncles, etc. While there are a few tidbits about the mother's early life -- there's nothing there that really rounds her out as a person. I would much rather have had the mother escape, and show up in later works, giving Dallas a chance to explore more of her past. As it is, I think Robb made a mistake on this one.",1

I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a great story about a couple who have been separated for years. You won't be disappointed.I'm not sure how I feel about this story.

"First off, you need to realize this has the Coleman name on it and that's it. It has none of the Coleman quality of the 1970's or even 80's.

It's made of thin plastic and doesn't feel very solid. It seems to work okay, I just got it and tried it out. If you are thinking this is anywhere near as bright as a Coleman gas lantern, it isn't even close. In a dark kitchen (at night, lights off) it lights up the room, but if you say wanted to read a book comfortably, you would need to be within at least 2 feet of direct level light from this thing. After 3 feet or so bright illumination degrades quickly.

The dimmer switch works but feels as if you need to be gentle with it. I woulnd't really recommend this for any real camping due to its construction.

On the plus side, it claims a long battery life and the carry handle works well. The light is not blinding when you look directly at the unit, so that is nice for in the house. Provides decent lighting in a home environment if the power were to be out of an extended period.

Also, the one I got was a bit scratched up and had some weird dust? in spots on it. They wiped off, but perhaps someone used it already? Who knows, maybe just poor quality control. I ordered through Amazon fulfillment.

I bought this in case the power goes out at home, so for that purpose it should be okay. However, if had known it was just a Coleman label on there and none of the quality (clearly made by the same company that makes all other cheap lanterns and badged as Coleman) I would have saved a bunch of money and just purchased a no-name look-a-like with similar results I'm sure.",1

Living in southern Arizona hats are a must if you are outdoors. It is hot and we have over 300 days of full sun. I own a tone of hats of all shapes and sizes. I was looking for a lighter weight hat I could wear under my bicycle helmet and for other sport activities. I have a mountain hardware hat that works well but does not have an adjustable strap to cinch it down tighter and the brim is smaller than this one. This hat works well to fill the gap for me. The material is definitely light weight without having a fragile too thin feel and the brim is full sized. The adjustable strap on the back is elastic so it has some flex to it and you can cinch it down as tight or loose as you want. One unique thing about this cap is that the adjustment strap has a clasp on it. I will attach a photo. The clasp is thin so it doesnt bother me even when worn under my bicycle helmet and if you have a pony tail you could unclip the strap and then clip it around you pony tail without having to pull it through like you are probably used to. This is the first hat I have seen with this feature. Very clever. The has is made from a synthetic material so it doesnt hold sweat or moisture and drys very quickly as a result. It has ventilation mesh on the sides to help it keep your head cool. It is not the thinnest or lightest hat I own but is close.

"Jessica and Simon are recalled to Mogo for training, meanwhile, Volthoom, the first wielder of a Power Ring is back controlling of the guardian Rami for his own ends.

Simon and Jessica's training dominates the first three issues and these are interesting bits. It's great to see them interact with the rest of the Green Lantern Universe and the characters who are traditionally associated with the Green Lanterns.

Volthoom's story continues in the background in the first two issues and then comes to the foreground in penultimate issue. This is an epic story that goes back to the founding of the Lanterns. Writer Sam Humphries has done a great job slowly teasing this out and there are some key revelations in this issue that set up Humphries' final collection.

The art is great as well. I particularly appreciate the versatility of the artist as they are not only able to beautifully render known characters but also species we haven't seen before.

Overall, this is another great installment of a superb Green Lantern series.",1
"I recently returned  a Porter-Cable 9866 cordless drill because the chuck was annoyingly bad. The P-C would not hold a screwdriver bit and scored the shanks of several of my round shank bits.
I replaced it with the DeWalt 983 and there is no comparison. The additonal few dollars are well worth it. I did jobs identical with those I attempted with the Porter-Cable and had no problems. These jobs included drilling in stainless steel and even as the bit broke through the work the DeWalt did not stall and the chuck held the number 3 bit flawlessly.
I only had one surprise with the DeWalt and that was that the clutch functions only on the high speed setting. I guess this makes sense as I don't need much torque when driving screws and the high speed setting easily drives #14 screws. I own several Porter-Cable tools and they are all excellent.

"This 2015 version of Mattel's My Password Journal has some significant improvements over&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/the-old-version/dp/B00IVFCCMA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">the old version</a>.

For starters, and probably most importantly for people who had the old one, there is a major improvement in the voice recognition.  Where before the password had to be said with EXACTLY the same tone (and background noise), the new version does a better (not perfect, but better) job of filtering background noise and is significantly more forgiving of the tone.  Fore example, when my 7yo tried to open her old Password Journal, if it didn't open the first time or two she would get frustrated and that frustrated tone would ensure it would not open at all.  This journal is more forgiving in the first place, and even if she gets frustrated it still responds about half of the time.

Now let's be real, this isn't a real diary-type journal.  It's definitely a gimmicky toy, so if your little one is looking for something more secure, an&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/old-fashioned-locking-diary/dp/B00NYAGMQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">old-fashioned locking diary</a>&nbsp;may be a better bet.  For the gadget girl who likes to fiddle with tech this is a fun toy, complete with invisible(-ish) ink, a ""hidden"" (in the most obvious way) compartment, and the namesake verbal password.  The journal book itself is small, but my 7yo took it out and keeps random notes to and from friends in there instead.  When she pressed her friends to try to get into the journal, it says ""intruder alert!"" and they all giggled wildly, scheming of ways to keep secret notes from their nemesis: little brother.

Of course there's a password bypass on the back, which means it's never really secure.  Which is fine, a 7yo doesn't need to be keeping secrets from her parents anyway.  ;-).",1
"My son is pretty obsessed with Blaze and the Monster Machines and unfortunately the only character we can seem to find literally anywhere is the original Blaze. So naturally, all the other characters we have to order online. Every time we think we have them all, they come out with new characters or variations of the main characters. Luckily, we have all the main characters now. These are not cheap knock off versions of the Nick Jr characters, they are the same ones you find at toy stores or big box stores. They are heavy duty, well made die cast trucks that have held up to my three year olds heavy playing and smashing them together and off of other things.",1

"There are many options out there for small aquariums.  So many questions.  Glass or acrylic... tall and skinny or short and long.... what kind of filter....  As a prior aquarium owner of both fresh and salt, starting with a 10 gal and working my way up to a 75, I have some experience with tanks and took a 10-year hiatus.  In 2010, my young son won a gold fish at the local state fair (imagine my dismay - a GOLDfish?  A dirty bottom feeder? ugh - haha).  We purchased a small 1-gal tank and needed to move up when this fish continued to grow and thrive!  We purchased this Eclipse tank because it was seamless (so I didn't need to worry about leaks on the dresser) and we liked the domed-front which actually makes the tank appear bigger than it is.  I have seen comments that some people don't like having to take the entire top off to maintain the tank, however, if you are going to see this tank from the TOP (which you will on a desktop or dresser), I cannot express how ***absolutely amazing*** it is to have one smooth top versus a hood with a filter sticking out of the back.  The tank is quiet and stays very clean, even with our two enormous goldfish.  We do a 25% water change every 5-6 weeks and rinse the filter cartridge out about every 2-3 weeks (or whenever needed).  Goldie and Diego are so huge now that we are looking for a bigger tank (again).  I've been out there looking (since there are 10 gal setups available for less than the Eclipse system - even an LED one from Marineland), however, we have decided to purchase the 12 gal Eclipse system - largely because of the fully enclosed top.  This is an excellent looking tank and I recommend it highly.",1

"Elmore Leonard has been inordinately successful getting his books adapted to the screen. Justified, the TV show based on the character Raylan Givens from Pronto, Riding the Rap, and the short story Fire in the Hole (the last adapted for the Justified pilot), is as good as any Leonard adaption. Seeing his characters with such incredible life breathed into him had to have spurred Leonard return to Givens.

Unfortunately, Leonard chose to tell a story in parallel to season 2 of Justified, allowing the show's writers to view early manuscripts. Raylan is composed of three major plotlines (almost three novellas loosely tied together). Two of those plotlines were featured heavily in season 2 of Justified. It's not that they hew so closely to the show that they bore the reader, it's that, in my opinion, Justified did them better. Boyd, in particular, is a far more compelling character on the show. Most other characters get far more time in the show to be developed. Raylan works much better when it departs from the stories told by the show.

I take as poor a view of mining companies as Leonard does, but the coal plotline gets a bit preachy. Again, Justified better captures the inner conflict of people in coal country--a desperate need for jobs and a deep-seated desire to be left alone by and distrust of outsiders.

If you're more of a casual Leonard fan who has seen Justified, I would recommend reading another Leonard novel next. If you're a diehard Justified fan looking for an introduction to Justified, I would recommend another Leonard novel, perhaps Riding the Rap or Pronto (neither of which I have read, although I've read Fire in the Hole). If you've read most of Leonard's work, love Justified, and have read Leonard's earlier work featuring Givens, then you probably will enjoy this book.",1

"It's difficult to open and close the side bags.  It really requires two hands, and when in saddle, that's annoying.  Hopefully we all have horses good enough that you CAN take your hands away from your reins, twist in your saddle, and fiddle with the zipper.  I do, but it's still annoying.

The cantle bag.  I put my oilskin duster (heavy trenchcoat type long jacket, for the men out there who don't know what it is) in the cantle bag, and I could not keep the whole rig right-side up...it kept slipping to one side.  I ended up having to do some serious anchoring to keep it mostly up.  Might be user error, but the next day I just tied my duster on the back of my cantle and left the bag in camp.

It's well-made.  I don't have a complaint about that.  And the pockets are nice & deep.  But I think I'll buy some cheaper ones that are easier to deal with in saddle.
Edit: about 2 years later.  I don't use the cantle bag.  I'm not a hardcore camper or anything like that.  The bags are used every few weekends on a ride (sometimes more).  Still inconvenient to get into in-saddle, but the bags are still in great shape, zippers in great shape. I bumped up from 3 to 4 stars.

"Leigh finally has to face the fact that she does indeed have feelings for Ryan that go deeper than surface lust. But she's still a girl who does her best to stay rooted in reality, and without concrete answers about where Ryan came from, it's difficult for Leigh to let go and fully trust the man who has her heart.

I had the pleasure of reading an early draft of More Than Words. What struck me most is that this conclusion is a delightful mix of the distinct mythology that played out in Unchained Melody and the charming elements of Contemporary Romance that went into Turn The Page. Add in some intensely heated bedroom scenes and seriously swoon-worthy actions by Mr. Weaver, and you've got a conclusion with some bite.

All of the events from the first two books come full circle, but not before Ryan and Leigh go through a roller coaster of emotions and have to confront many truths about his past.

If you're on the hunt for something that feels both paranormal and contemporary, this is a series that somehow manages to feel like both. And S.K. Munt delivers another memorable book hunk that rivals Tristan from her well-known Fairytail Saga. This is the kind of romance that should be accompanied by a folding fan.",1

"I wasn't sure if I was going to like this or not - a mix of Tudor history and fantasy/magic? I was pleased to find that it was excellent, and I read it in two days!

The author clearly knows her subjects very well indeed, which always makes such a difference. The history itself is detailed and accurate, and I very much liked the accounts of the day to day domestic life of the period. I'm fascinated by the thought of possible alternative lives, and the idea of what might have happened had Henry VIII believed his wife Anne Boleyn over the accusations of her enemies is an intriguing one. Of course all events have a butterfly's wing effect, and Ms Taylor imagined the fates of other members of the Tudor court very cleverly. The politics of the day are very well described, too; how quickly, in those dangerous and turbulent times, one could fall from favour...

I am not usually one for magic/fantasy novels, but this element of the story was most convincing; it made me think of a more grown up and serious Hogwarts! I wonder how much of it was just the author's imagination and how much was taken from the beliefs and practices of the time; I imagine it's a combination of the two. I particularly liked the parts about numerology and the breaking of codes; oddly enough I was only watching a TV programme last night about the use of codes in secret communications during Elizabethan times, and Ms Taylor has all this spot on. To sum up, the fusing of history with fantasy is very successful, and I shall definitely be reading the next book in the series before too long. I think it would appeal to anyone interested in the Tudor period, and to those who enjoy reading believable fantasy.",1

"Aurora Rose Reynolds took possessive to a whole new level with Justified and I LOVED every single second of it. Ms. Reynolds has always been a go-to of mine when I'm in the mood for an alpha, but Nolan is by far the most possessive, protective, and yes, obsessed, alpha I've ever had the pleasure of meeting and Chloe is absolutely perfect for him.

Usually when I'm reading a novella I have a hard time feeling the connection between the hero and heroine but the connection between Nolan and Chloe was obvious from the first word. Yes, Nolan's an ass, and okay, maybe Chloe is a bit of a doormat, but who cares? It works for them, and it worked for me while I was reading it!

I love the whodunnit aspect of the story, but I love how that's not necessarily the main focus. The main focus totally being the smoking hot sexy times between Nolan and Chloe, of course! But I LOVE how they always end it with ""I Love You""... It adds the perfect amount of sweetness to counter balance the hotness.

My only complaint would be that I wish it were longer. And it would have been great to read from the beginning of their relationship, though even starting after they're already together I didn't really feel that we missed anything... That's just me being selfish and wanting more.

I cannot wait for the rest of this series and I'm really hoping we get to see more of Chloe and Nolan, too!

As far as adventure goes, it was great.  Although, the ""quest"" was resolved way too easily.  All the sudden it was just over, which was highly unsatisfying.

The two main characters fell in love too easily.  Almost a love of convenience, in fact.  There could've been so much more.  At time, you see a glimpse of depth in the hero, but it quickly disappears.  Even the steamy parts were lacking because you didn't feel any emotional attachment between the two characters. It seemed out of place, even.

If you are interested in historical accuracy and developed characters, skip this one.  If you want a story to entertain you on a rainy afternoon, it will do the trick just fine.",1

"I own 4 Mini Schnauzers.  This doggy door has been a dream.  We installed it on the ground level of our basement door.  I am no longer a door man for my dogs.  Yah!  My dogs learned to be completely potty trained by 4 months of age, since they could go outside when they needed to go.  The 2 flaps close fairly reliably to keep out the bitter cold.  This ends up to be quite an energy saver since only a little air gets in the house.  Compare that to the amount of air that comes in the house when you have to open a door for a dog to go outside.

Here is the drawback.  My dogs love to grab shoes and anything else they can find and drag it out to the back yard.  I have to go out regularly to pick up the things they drag out there.  I also have to close the door occasionally since they can start to dig holes in the yard if given too much outdoor freedom.  I also close the door occasionally so the dogs won't bark at neighbors.  That is OK with me.  Overall this doggy door gives me and the dogs so much more freedom to do our thing!  Yes I do love it!",1

"I don't buy low quality dog food, never have. My Airedale is 2 and 1/2 years old. I started her out on Nutro which was ok, switched to Canidae as I was influenced by dog food purists. Canidae was decent food for an astronomical price. Then I noticed Newmans own organic dog food. I decided to try it out on the subscribe and save program, supplementing along with Canidae. My dog loves it more than expensive Canidae. Soon she was eating more Newmans than the expensive brand. She is fit and trim, her coat is healthy and pretty. She has no tell-tale itching associated with inferior dog food. The ingredient list of Newmans own is IMPRESSIVE! I have continued receiving this dog food on the subscribe and save program. It arrives to my front porch every month. Im totally happy with the product and the service from Amazon. Ive never seen Newmans own dog food at any retail store. My dog has eaten this food for 2 years.",1
"This bike rack is great and does exactly what I needed to do--hang my bike vertically off a wall in my home. The included hardware worked great and allowed me to anchor into the drywall of the wall that I hung the bike from. In the end it allowed me to save a lot of space in my small studio.

The dimensions of this rack are 9 inches tall by 3 inches wide. The top hook that goes around the tire sticks out 4.5 inches. The bottom part that sticks out a bit on either side of the bike rim sticks out about 1.5 inches.
Included in this set is the bike rack and the hardware needed to mount it.

Pros:
*Saves a ton of room
*Hardware included that worked well
*Easy to install

Cons:
*None

Additional Considerations:
Be aware, this is a vertical storage system, not a horizontal one. Additionally you will want to make sure the bike is not ran into a lot or you could damage the bike or the wall that the bike rack is mounted into.

Overall: 5/5 stars (>=.5 rounds up, <.5 rounds down) => 5 stars

But I wasn't prepared to  replace the failed unit with the same model so I ordered this one which has been working well so far.

Update:

I was thinking about going with this camera and decided to buy a Canon 2D with a 2D sensor.  I have had several Canon 3D cameras and I just can't get enough of them.  The 2D sensor is perfect for me.  I have had no problems shooting the 3D, I shoot with my Canon, not with the camera.  The Canon 2D is great for the price.  I have not had any issues shooting 3D on this camera.  The only issue I have is the battery life.  I have had a 3D camera for several years now and have had good battery life.

"These magnets came neatly packaged in four columns within a flat little box.  The magnets are about the size of a dime, maybe slightly bigger.  One side is plain and the other has a groove in it.  I thought only one side would stick, but it works with either side.  I mainly bought these for my mom who enjoys sticking photos to her fridge.  As a project, I laminated all her photos and then we used these magnets to stick them to the fridge.  These were strong enough to hold the one sheet of laminated photo per magnet, which worked out fine for what we needed.  However, if you were to add say two or three sheets of laminated photo, the magnets don't seem to be as strong.  These are not the strongest magnet, but they are not the weakest either.  They can hold up about three to four sheets of unlaminated photos, just to give you and understanding of their strength.  So, if your papers get too thick, these magnets will lose their magnetism.",1

"I rented this DVD only out of curiosity because I had heard of this often overlooked sci-fi entry made by Mario Bava. To be honest, given its' B-movie status, I was expecting a rather one dimensional gore-fest.

Nothing could be further from the truth. Even at this early point in his career, one can see how talented a director Bava is.

Clearly shot on a low budget, like Roger Corman, Brava, by using some very clever camera approaches and wonderfully creative sets (its' quite obvious the makers of the Alien films used this along with other 1950s' B-movies as sources)constructs a film that is both intelligent and engaging.

This book had the same unanswered sub-plots  the others books in the series have with no real connection to the other books. I understand the author wants each book in the series to stand alone but it annoys when each feels like it should have a sequel. I did like the development of both the characters and the romance.

"Want to know the bane of an electric car?  I will say that it's a pretty good electric car.  The motor is solid and takes the guesswork out of how much power it needs.  It does a good job of pulling the fuel out of the car and does a great job of avoiding the nasty gas smells that can occur in the car.  It also has a nice height knob that adjusts the height of the car.  I like that the car has a motor that is adjustable from about 1,000 to about 1,000 watts.  That is a big plus.  I am happy with the car because it has a nice weight to it.  The only downside I have is that I don't like the ""gift"" feature.  I wanted something that would be easier to use and I thought the gift feature was a good feature.  I gave it to my friend and she loved it.

"I have kinda a love/hate relationship with these flashlights. I love that they are super affordable and you get three flashlights. They are plastic, not aluminum, but the tolerances seem tight and they appear relatively water resistant. I left the floodlight on last night and after 4-1/2 hours the light intensity was down to about 25%, but still usable.

The non-focusing flashlight produces a tight, bright beam that easily illuminates objects 50-75 feet away. The light bar floodlight works great for close up work or will light half a room bright enough to read. The rubberized flat black exterior is nice and ""grippy."" The magnet is sufficient to hold the light vertically or horizontally on smooth sheet metal.

Ugly? Oh, man I so wish they provided directions on how to open these suckers up to insert the batteries! (3 AAA--not included) TIP: half the textured base near the magnet (opposite the on/off switch) slides open. There is a faint black arrow at the opening.

The bad? These lights have three settings--flashlight, floodlight and flashing red LED lights. Two of my flashlights worked perfectly, but the flashing red LED's never worked on the third. No biggie and I'm keeping them all, but it bodes ill for the reliability.

Still, these things are so cheap I can't complain--much.

UPDATE--that third flashlight with the non-operational red LED's? It drained the batteries flat while turned off! Obviously a bad circuit. I threw it away. A 33% failure rate is nothing to brag about.",1

"""Ordinary Men"" chronicles the rise and fall of Reserve Police Battalion 101, one of several units that took part in the Final Solution to the Jewish Question while in Poland. During the course of their stay, they were responsible for the shooting of 38,000 Jews, while also deporting 45,200 to the Treblinka Concentration Camp. The book argues that the men of Reserve Police Battalion 101, and other units like it, were comprised of ordinary men. It begs the question: How did ordinary men become the cold-blooded killers of the Holocaust?

Author Christopher R. Browning does a tremendous job of covering the ground. He also presents a strong case that these people were indeed ordinary men, who came from ordinary backgrounds, only to end up being transformed into the murderers of thousands. However, the book also stresses that some of the men, including several officers, could not be considered ""ordinary,"" as they were trained in Hitler's Nazi organizations from youth. Browning also does something nearly impossible: He humanizes these people without excusing their horrendous actions. Their defense that ""they were just following orders"" just doesn't fit the bill, as some refused to take part in the actions, and asked to be relieved. If a few men could get themselves relieved from doing the killings, why did so many more not? That is the main question the book gives. ""Ordinary Men"" is an extraordinary book that chronicles just one unit that took part in the murder of innocent Jews, while also presenting a good case of how ordinary men can become killers. I highly recommend this book to all students of the Holocaust.",1

"Understanding that all wax seals will eventually fail, I researched the alternatives and purchased this Danco seal and a Fluidmaster rubber seal - in case one didn't work properly. The toilet it was to be used with is about a year old and is from the American Standard ""Mainstream"" family.

The floor is tiled and level. The toilet flange is the newest PVC flange that Oatey makes, is ""above the floor"", and level.

The specs on this Danco seal state that it will work with flanges that are ""above the floor"", up to 1/2"" tall.

This seal didn't compress enough to allow the toilet to sit flush with the floor. It just rocked side to side. There was no error with the installation as the toilet was repositioned several times to ensure that a proper ""set down"" onto the Seal was made. There just simply wasn't enough room between the outlet on the bottom of the toilet and the top of the flange for this Seal to fit into.

You know what worked? The cheapie old Harvey wax ring. Prepped and placed the toilet down the first time and flush the toilet sits.

Maybe this Danco Seal works for some combinations of toilets and flange heights - but if you want to save yourself some grief, purchase and have on hand the good ole' wax ring just in case you're in the predicament I was in.

"Review: Dark Wolf (A Carpathian Novel) by Christine Feehan
Release Date: January 7, 2014 | Series: Carpathian (Book 24)
Reviewed by:  Reading in Pajamas/ Donna
Rated: 4.5 Stars
Blog Post: [...]

REVIEW:
This smoking hot paranormal romance had all the aspects of the Carpathian novels we have grown to love. The danger and intrigue at times left me breathless, but that was tempered well with the love and friendship loaded on the pages. This story also had a fun group of friends that I believed had been together for years. I enjoyed Skylers strength and determination that was clearly shown without ever losing her softness.  Dimitri was perfect for her and the romance flowed smoothly. All in all a well written story that was very hard to put down and I am still lost in their world.

"This is a second novel I've read from Colleen Collins, and again she delivers with a 'big bang'. The hero is an attorney, heroine a private eye. At one time, she was his law firm's private investigator, but after stepping into the legal-gray-area one too many times, he put her on probation with a stern warning that one more slip-up, she's out. What he doesn't know is that her ""questionable"" investigation uncovered a growing sinkhole in his personal life, one that could destroy his world...something he learns too late. And then what is the next right thing to do? A question both of them face.
Suspense and right ingredients of the romance pushes this well written novel to the top of my list of the titles at the moment. Highly recommended.",1

"These filters leak and will not install on my shower. I thought I got them from a company called Pure Earth, but I got them from Amazon. When I called Pure Earth about them, the guy did not want to help me and kicked me off to the manufacturer, who has a number that gives  me a fast busy, so no help there. I am currently trying to contact the Sporting Goods place that sells these through Amazon to try to resolve. Turns out I got them here on Amazon, and the ones I got are very cheaply made, very poor manufacturing and you can't reach the company that makes them, so I would not recommend. The industry does not seem to be a very friendly place in general, and I have not been able to resolve this. If anyone knows of a GOOD vitamin C Filter, please comment :)

To be truthful I still prefer it over the wave; however, there are times when I have gotten beans and they taste significantly better on the Wave, usually beans from South America.

I say this because there have been a couple times where I accidentally overpour with my kettle when preheating the dripper/prewetting the filter. What happens with overpour is sometimes the weight of the water will cause creases in the filter and mess up the distribution of the water. You end up with a less tasty cup.",1

"There are some great ideas here. The only problem is that it's not really a book about the Civil War.  The Civil War is a social history of the United States, and that's not really what the book is about.  There are many people who still remember the war, and a lot of them are still alive today.  There is a lot of research on the Civil War, but there is not much else.  The book is about a group of people who went to war in order to gain the right to vote, and that is not what the book is about.

"Overall I like it, but it has the design flaw. I will admit that it's a bit annoying. If you want to get a solid feel for the feel of the blade, it's worth it. If you want a solid feel for the feel of the blade, you'll have to pay a bit more for it to work. I'd be more inclined to buy this knife if it didn't have the design flaw",0
"Wonderful set!!!  I bought three and did a sneak peek at the hidden one. Each set had the Ultra Rare Pink Glitter Bulldog and unlike some I have seen each had perfect glitter without flaws (my guess is because he stays in place unlike movement if he were in a blind bag).
Just wish the Rare ones came with a little tag like the shopkins do saying it is number 561 out of 1000 or whatever.",1
"I like it but it's too big for most garbage bags. I have to use an oversized bag for a liner. As in other reviews, it came dented. How can the company keep shipping these without putting them in a decent box?",1
"Have had this camera since March, and I love it. I had a Digital Elph before this, so I was a little spoiled by how tiny they are and how easily they fit into a pocketbook, but this one can fit, too... just a little bulkier because of the ""hump"" for the batteries.

It takes clear pictures and video, has withstood my dropping it, and does a good job of focusing on faces.

Two negatives: first, the lag between photos can be unbearable, particularly when the flash has been discharged. I tried taking pictures in a theatre and had to wait literally about 30 seconds in between shots... which is terrible when you're trying to capture something as it's happening! When I loaned the camera to someone, she told me, ""I'd return it if I were you. I have no idea how you stand that.""

Thing is, I love just about everything else about it. If I had the money, I'd buy a different camera to use indoors and keep this one for the outdoors/good lighting shots.

The other negative is that it really isn't great with red eyes. My whole family is prone to red eyes, and haven't yet found a camera that reliably fixes that problem.

I'm still a fan.",1
"Finally, just bricks!!! My 6 year old is really getting into building blocks. We have mostly Lego brand but have been frustrated that most of their sets because they are lacking just the basic blocks so our collection at this point has way too many specialty pieces. We were very happy with the base plates we purchased from Play Platoon so when we converted our train table into a Lego table so when we saw they sold collections of just bricks we were super excited!! This bag of bricks did not disappoint!  They worked perfectly with the Lego brand blocks and base plates we own. This pastel color collection is great for boys or girls. My son was excited because he said it had ""ice cream"" colors. Overall, we are very pleased and happy to have a great collection of bricks.

I was given the opportunity to purchase this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I have no relationship or affiliation will the seller. All of my reviews reflect my honest opinion. Please, feel free to ask any questions in the comment section and I will try to respond. Have a great day and happy shopping.",1

"I am searching online to find an easy way to make this shirt work for me. I ordered the size 6.5 and it fit perfectly. The fabric is soft and it is stretchy. The material is not see through so it will be fine if you don't have a lot of pockets. The bottom is a bit snug but I can wear it on my shoulder and I'm sure it will stretch. The top is a bit too small but I like that it's not too tight. I'm sure it will be fine. I've only worn it twice so I don't know how it will hold up. I haven't worn it at all yet but I'm sure it'll be fine.I'm 5'4"" and 140lbs, and ordered a medium for my 5'8"", 195lbs, the size I normally wear was too big. I've ordered a medium in a few other brands and have had no luck finding a fit. I think I might order a small. The sizing on the other brands is way off.

I like the color and that it has 2 doors but the latches are a hassle. You have to make sure they are moved out of the way before you try to close the  door and it's takes twice as long since there are 2 latches on each door. The paint is already chipping around the latches.,1
"All I will say is that this is my 2nd purchase of this item. Why? So I can have one facing out the rear of my work vehicle. I spend a LOT of time on the roads and.. well.. you know.. Bought my first one (forward facing) almost 3 years ago. Yes, it saved me a couple issue for sure. With all of the options out there (including newer DOD products), to come back and spend the extra money on this DOD should be testament itself into its quality. BTW, although this came with a 16GB, I still upgraded to a 64GB flash. Did I need it, don't know... LOL. I feel better storing more info before rewriting though.
Can't go wrong here.

The twists and turns of this book will keep you on the edge of your chair.  It would make a great movie to help expose the problem of human trafficing that takes place around the world.

But, it could be a lot better.  The camera lens zoom and focus is pre-set and not adjustable.  The only way to change the zoom is to physically move the camer back or forth.  This makes finding a place to hide the camera much more difficult and challanging. The mounting bracket also adds to the challenge--it doubles the height of the unit, and is intended to be mounted with the included, tiny wood wood screws.  Using the the knob on the receiver to fine tune the reception from the transmitter is what migraines are made of--keep the Tylenol handy. It's similar to trying to fine tune the dial on an am clock radio with week reception.

OMG Ashley Beale is an amazing author. Her books are captivating, complex and full of suspense. I had a hard time putting down until the very end. The chemistry between these two was so intense.

"I had fun watching ""Bad Teacher."" It's not a great film by any means, and I don't plan on repeated viewings, but it was enjoyable to watch once.

What's interesting about the film is that it's about a character that is completely morally reprehensible, and yet still comes across as likable. Much of this probably has to do with Cameron Diaz, who is just such a likable actress. She's a beautiful woman with a knockout figure and a mega-watt smile, and yet she's so goofy and willing to make fun of herself that even when she's playing nasty characters it's hard not to find her charming.

And boy is this character nasty. She's greedy, she's lazy, and she's selfish. She lies, she steals, she manipulates. What's also interesting is that the storyline of the repugnant central character, Elizabeth, does not fall into either of the two clichs that you'd expect from a Hollywood film:

1) She does not end up finding herself inspired by the children and discover a love of teaching, revealing a heart of gold hidden beneath her prickly exterior.

2) She does not find herself getting her comeuppance for being such an awful human being.

If anything, the characters in the film who are depicted as truly pathetic are Elizabeth's sincere, hardworking fellow teachers. Is this a dubious message? Perhaps. But the performers are all so funny and likable (Lucy Punch and Justin Timberlake are both hilarious) that they manage to make up for the film's many flaws.",1

"As stated by the title...this product is NOT FOR TALL PEOPLE!  The zippered opening does not allow for someone much taller than about 5'11"" to get into it.  If you are short, you can get into the costume easily feet first.  If you are tall, you must go in head first, lay down and cross your legs and get someone to help you put your feet into the correct places.  I could BARELY bend my legs enough to fit them into the leg openings, even having wiggled my shoulders up into the head area as much as I could.  Now as long as you're under that height I mentioned, your weight doesn't matter a bit.  It's a very forgiving costume and would be very easy for a plus size person to wear.  I don't know what the limit would be, but we were able to get my ~300lb friend into it with no trouble.

The fan makes an annoying sound...so it's not like you could wear this to work and sit at your computer quietly.  But changes are...you're going to be running around like an idiot at a party in this thing so nobody will care about the fan whirr.

It does get hot inside and you will fog up the thing.  There's no way for this really to be avoided.  Costume feels super cheap when you take it out of the package and you'll need to find somewhere inside the suit to secure the fan.  I'm unable to wear this costume without having someone help me get in and out of it, due to my height, but if you're shorter you should be able to manage ok.

You can run, walk, bicycle, drive, sit, dance, all very easily.  It's very light and if you bump into something, it just deflates that part and fills right back up quickly.  Fun to run around in and scare children.",1

"One of the best purchases I have made this decade.  I have a woman....and ""older"" woman who just does not have the grip that I used to for home repairs.  I have tried various electric screwdrivers from name-brand companies like Black and Decker but they just did not give me the push I needed.  A friend recommended this from across the Country, so he had to convince me that....no, it is not too heavy for me.  Yes, it is very easy to grip, load, and charge.  Yes, it has plenty of power and will hold the charge through all my projects!  He recommended that I just get a board and put screws in it, then reverse and take out.  I did....I only needed to do that twice before I was all over the inside and outside of my house taking care of those long-awaited projects.  I actually laid it down in the kitchen and forgot where I put in a week ago.  I thought I was going to go through withdrawal!  I have been using this tool at least every other day since I got it and am now creating new projects to use it with.  Trust this girl who has more power tools than most men!",1
"I was expecting the Lotr audio book THIS IS NOT THE AUDIOBOOK I have read the Lord of the Rings many times and I have seen the movies many times but I think this might be one of the worst versions of the story, with the irrating voices talking over each other,  the cheesie 70's sound effects. if your a fan and haven't read the book you may enjoy this.",1

I'm a new mom of a 9 year old and I've always wanted to have a baby girl.  I am very happy with this product and am happy with the price.  This is a great toy and I highly recommend it.I bought this as a gift for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it!  I did have to write a review on it since it has already been played with quite a bit and I can't tell you how many times I have been able to play with it without having to put the little pieces back in the box.  I think it's a great addition to any princess collection!  It's a nice size and my daughter loves it!  I'll be returning it to Amazon to see if there is a way to keep it for her or for me to keep,0
"I got a Kindle for Christmas and wanted to get a cute, but protective cover for it.  I did a lot of research, and M-Edge seemed to get really high reviews, so I bought one.

I got the fuchsia cover. It looks much different on my computer monitor than it does in person. On the monitor it looks more like a rose pink, but in reality it's a super bright, neon pink. I love pink, but I don't want it to stand out THAT much. It's really, really bright.

I knew this cover wasn't leather (unfortunately), but once I touched it I was disappointed in the feel of it.  Yes it is soft and smooth, but it looks and feels like plastic ""Pleather."" It really does have a bad over, but I was spoiled by leather in the past. No, it's not leather... but I knew that when I bought it, so I can't hold that against it.

Overall, I think the design of this cover is fabulous. I love how it incorporates the E-Luminator (sold separately). It's quite a slick design. I love that I can store the E-Luminator right in the case.  I also love the strap that keeps the book securely closed or open.  It folds back on itself like a dream, and is very comfortable to hold either open or folded back. The inside has a nice microfiber suede-like lining that offers protection against scratches.

It's a great case.. really great, if you don't mind the plastic cover.  I am hoping that they will offer leather versions in the future, and more color choices.",1

"I would like to tell you that I used this and love it, but by the time I found this, ordered it, and finally received it, I was done with my particular job.  What I see here is a perfect looking replacement for the 10-15% silver content rod that we all pay thorugh the nose for normally.  Forney promises that this will do just as well...... my best guess based upon previous Forney products used is that it will be equal, or very likely,.... a bit better than the expensive stuff.  However that may be, I do NOT know that for sure yet.  I do not need it it right now, and have no jobs in the immediate future to do so.  Later on, if I find it is a lot better, I will find and update this posting.  I do hope it helps someone out there who is fearful of it failing.  As I said, the Forney name is why I bought it, and based upon my history with Forney, this is good stuff and will save you a LOT of hard earned money to do the same job just as well!  Enjoy.",1
"I was going to write a great review about this product a while ago, but kept delaying it.  And it's a good thing I delayed it.  This hard drive lasted about 3.5 years.  I bought it in May 2010 and it broke in December of 2013.  I never used it heavily.  Only used it as backup.  Finally, it went bad.  I still have a couple of hard drives by this brand that I purchased between 6 and 10 years ago and they're still operating.",1

"This is honestly such a great toy! My almost 5yo and almost 2yo have been playing with this for over a year. It's huge! It occupies them. My son always wants to make a fort, so this is perfect. It's 2 pieces that attach together. Downtowns we just use one piece and take the red top part and cover the top. The kids have so much fun chasing each other through this. I love that it stores flat and takes up no space which is great if you live in a small house or apt. I sometimes put those crawl tunnels through it as well, which is another great thing that stores flat. It's easy to put up and take down. Tons of imaginative play!",1

"I bought a 3 pack of deer antlers from WhiteTail Naturals for my dogs.  I have a medium size retriever/aussy mix and a small Rat Terrier.  They both like to chew on antlers.  They will chew on these if the other ones I bought are not around.  However they are not as ""preferred"".  I think they may be older as the other ones I bought were marketed as current year antlers and the dogs clearly prefer them.

All in all these are pretty good but not as good as others so I am only rating them with four stars.",1
"My 9 yr. old requested this for Christmas.  While it was fun for a little while (even stumping it got boring), it's luster wore off quickly and it has been pushed aside already.  The questions are the same over and over again - which is only logical (it uses deductive reasoning), it's voice gets annoying and it sometimes doesn't understand your response (how many times do you need to repeat the word ""no""?).

"The Buttkicker adds a bit of shake to your home theatre.  It doesn't replace the subwoofer, but sort-of turns the floor into a lower subwoofer.  And I love it.  But there are some things you should know.

First, the LFE Kit (with Amp) is probably the best choice to start with because you can't drive it from your receiver - not enough power.  So getting in the game will cost you around $500. Which is more than for Aura Bass Shakers, but far better.

Second, one LFE Kit will do a sofa nicely, but if you, like me, mount it under your floor, you're gonna need two.  Possibly more, but probably two.  Because that's a LOT more mass to shake, and otherwise they'll be maxxing out and making a loud knocking noise.

Third, it's not like riding a rollercoaster.  You'll feel the floor shake from loud sound effects, bombs, etc., but don't expect magic.  It makes the movie more real, but it doesn't toss you around.

All that said, it's a great addition.  If you can afford the cost-of-entry, you'll be amazed how shallow the system feels with it off.",1
"I bought this light 2 years ago to put in my son's room as a night light, and the matching blue star light. The yellow cover is not as opaque as the blue star light and puts out more light. Enough to brighten the room to see where you're going, and that's about it, which is just what we wanted. It screws into the wall and then has a long white cord with a toggle switch for on/off. We never turn ours off.

The light comes with a 25 watt bulb. After almost 2 years of leaving this light on 24/7, the bulb burnt out. I searched everywhere and could not find a bulb! Several reviewers had luck at Lowes, but I did not. After a lot of research and buying several bulbs that didn't fit, I found that the bulb has a European base, which is not easily bought in the US. The base size needed is E14, and standard candelabra bulbs are E12. So I searched on Amazon and found a converter that allows an E12 base bulb to fit in an E14 socket. I got a 6-pack of converters for less than $8 and bought a pack of E12 base candelabra 25-watt bulbs. And it worked perfectly! The light is a little bit brighter with the new bulb than it was before.

I'm so glad I got the bulbs to work because I really didn't want to get rid of this light. Not only because I love the light, but because it screws into the wall and I didn't want to have to worry about covering up the holes :/",1

"I really like this kitchen. I like the clean minimalist design, that it's wooden, and that it's smaller yet still has room for 2 toddlers to play.

What I didn't like about this product is that one of th sides didn't come with the correct predrilled holes, and after contacting Amazon and Hape, I could not get a replacement part. They did offer several other ""solutions"" but bottom line is, the top of my kitchen still isn't properly secured on one sid because the holes weren't secured properly and I could not get a replacement part.

"Fit: I wear size 9 ladies shoes, and the sock size 9-11 fits well, without pulling on the toes.  The leg portion is very comfortable, but the top of the band leaves an indentation in my leg, and that's why I dropped one star from these excellent socks.  I'm folding the tops down to avoid that, but in my active outdoor life, I prefer higher socks for protection against insect bites.

For running around the house in socks, these are wonderfully comfy.  Where they really shine, though, is when you put on your shoes, and they never felt so good!

Construction:  You can see in the picture the open mesh knit on the top of the foot for coolness.  There's a ribbed band that goes completely around your instep to hug your foot. The bottom of the sock, including the top of the toes and up the back of the heel (except for the area of the instep ribbing) is all cushioned with terry loop knit on the inside.  So the sole is thicker than the top, and it's very comfortable.  You have cushioning where you need it most, without making the socks too hot or bulky.

Materials: With years of experience knitting socks myself, I can advise that for long-lasting socks, get at least 10% nylon in the fibers.  These socks exceed that, and should wear very well.

These are my favorite store-bought socks yet, but I'll keep looking for something that doesn't leave an indentation on my calf.  You can bet I'll be wearing these often in the meantime, though, and especially in hot weather.

UPDATE: After several trips through the washer and dryer, they've shrunk, and feel uncomfortably tight, especially around my ankle.  They're still comfortable in shoes, but I limit how long I have them on because of the restrictive feeling.",1

"This is the best book I've read in 2017 -- funny, sad, entertaining, totally satisfying, At the end (a denouement I never expected), I wanted to turn back and read it again to watch for the preparation and clues Towles had scattered throughout.

What's to be said about a book in which the protagonist (a Former Person to the Bolsheviks, Count Rostov to his friends) is under house arrest in a Moscow hotel for 40 years, Nikita Khrushchev plays a very small part, and New York Times correspondent Harrison Salisbury's overcoat is crucial to the way it all works out?  But the plot isn't the best part -- it is Towles' light-hearted prose style. Though he doesn't let the reader forget the horrors that were occurring outside -- massive starvation, five-year plans that didn't work, World War II -- what is important here is one man's mastery of his circumstances.",1

"I upgraded from the S4i which, despite the ear tip choices, didn't quite fit right. While I can't justify that the high price of the X10i has anything, if any, to do with fit, they DO fit much better. Maybe it's the obtuse, minimalist design as compared to the slight rear bulge of the S4i (not that those were big in the first place). Now I'm able to hear instruments in songs I never heard before!

You'll hear EVERYTHING with these, which can be good or bad, especially if you listen to a song encoded poorly. My mp3s aren't lossless by any means, but the clarity the X10i gives is unparalleled. I was expecting to hear much more hisses and clicks, but surprisingly I haven't (lucky, i guess). It hits all the highs and lows just the way I like them!

I use these mainly while playing my e-drum kit through a Roland TD-9, so its discriminating fidelity is important to me.

If these reviews only focused on the product in-hand, then I would have posted 5 out of 5 stars. IMHO, reviews encompass all that comes with the product, from its accessories to the warranty period. I gave the X10i 4 stars for the following reasons: 1) At such a premium price, why aren't the included airplane and 1/4"" adapters gold just like the headphone's 3.5 mm jack? I don't lower my audiophilic standards on a flight or when plugging these into a stereo receiver. 2) I can't justify a 350% price increase between these and the S4i, which were a great-sounding pair of headphones (when they fit) at a much lower price point.

"As with everything, the rechargeable battery will last a long time.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very hard to install, so you have to drill down a little to get the batteries in. If you are going to use it for a lot of jobs, it will be a pain. I would recommend using the battery with a strong enough wire. I just put the wire in a little bit and it will be all right. I have no idea how to program it for a lot of jobs, but I'm not going to put it in a shop or garage.

Overall, I was very happy with this product. It is a very good product for the price. I would recommend it for those situations where you want to keep it at a good distance from your work area. I have used it for about a year and it still works.I really like these. They are great for taking a shower. They are very bright and they are very small. They fit my shower head perfectly.

"Install went smoothly except the intake hoses are quite slim and twisted when trying to attach them.
I read some people had problems with the head not retracting.
I put the old weight on the the hose along with the new one - works for me.

I love the the easy button switch to stop the water temporarily.  Say I want to fill a pot on the counter.  Turn on the water, grab the head, push the stop button, and no splash or wet counters.
 I've had issues with other one handle faucet designs shutting off by themselves.  The faucet I replaced would only stay on if I had the water on full blast.  This handle does not do that.  Now I can peel eggs under water easily.

I can't attest to durability yet, but so far so good.",1

"Excellent story --- reads like a spy novel thriller, as the cliche goes.  Except this time, it's no cliche. Which is why Luke Harding's book is the basis of the forthcoming movie adaptation directed by Oliver Stone and starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Edward Snowden.

Harding's advantage here is that he had a ringside seat as his colleagues at The Guardian were handed this opportunity.  They didn't blow the assignment.  Harding depicts the steely nerve on display here, ranging from Snowden to Guardian colleagues like investigative journalist Glenn Greenwald, then-editor Alan Rusbridger and then-deputy editor Janine Gibson.",1

Robert De Niro is one of my very favorite actors, and as I very much expected, he did not disappoint. I also loved Jody Foster, I have seen many movies of hers, and I also love her acting very much. I liked Peter Boyle also, whom I got to know from ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" and from what I saw in Taxi Driver, there is a mischievous quality about him that seems to come through always. And last, but not least, Harvey Keitel just blew my mind! If you haven't seen it yet and like, or at least tolerate, this particular genre of gore, I'm willing to bet that, in seeing these actors' work in their beginnings will show clearly and unmistakably the reason why they have become huge stars and received so many accolades.",1

The thing is so big it's almost difficult to work with.  You need to be rather strong to get it moved around set up even before you begin cranking.

This is very well made, of exceptional quality, and amazingly strong.  Made right here in the good old USA.  You can buy this thing, use the tar out of it, and give it to your grown child someday and he can then give it to his kid some day.  Really, it's that well made.  I just wish the manual did a little better job of indicating lubrication points.  Perhaps if it had a picture with arrows indicating spots to lubricate.",1
"I was excited to purchase these due to the pretty colors offered and the reviews posted. The first time I went to use them though, I regretted my decision. They are hard to attach and are impossible to put around a bra strap unless one is wearing a flimsy slip-type strap that is made for show rather than support. I will keep them but will now need to take the time and effort to sew on a different type of attaching device. These are clumsy at best and made for young teen-wear rather than a mature full figured-woman who needs these cover-ups. I suggest looking elsewhere unless you are attaching to very thin straps and have the time and dexterity to attach these clumsy made buttons. (They remind me of the old garter attachments that attached to hose..younger readers will be clueless about that comment) Also I am not certain about how the lace will hold up in the wash. They will probably need to be gently hand-washed as the lace is not the thicker quality I am use to.",1

"I bought this light not knowing what to expect so from the beginning:  Packing was great; the light arrives in a hard case that has fitted inserts that hold everything in place safely and comfortably, no hassle getting charger, light, and strap in and out. Next, accessories that come with the light, besides the hard case, the light comes with everything you need for getting started I especially like the shoulder strap that it comes with, the light is larger and heavier than I expected and when Im working with it for extended periods of time it starts to get heavy. The flashlight comes with attachment points for the shoulder strap so they thought that part out well. The light itself is brighter than some construction site wobble lights Ive used and is capable of lighting up entire room(s) by just standing it up in the middle of the room and letting the light bounce of the ceiling and walls which is very impressive. Outside, the light throws out a powerful beam that (I use it in a pitch dark 5 acre property) is the best that Ive experienced. Thank goodness the flashlight has three light settings, I use the middle setting most of the time but its great to have options. Finally, the flashlight has a battery indicator that really comes in handy so I don't get caught short of charge.",1

"The Turning Point isn't as lightweight as it appears. Shirley MacLaine's performance as the dancer-turned-mother and wifie, and Ann Bancroft's role as the aging ballerina who won't let go of the past is quite realistic. Each woman is struggling with an ego that won't allow them to voice their true emotions, all fear-based and poignant. One fears that she wasn't ever good enough to become the star her friend went on to be, and hides behind motherhood and a veiled jealousy of her daughter who is definitely on her way. The other is also jealous of the life her friend has, and fears growing old and being forgotten by the dance world she loves and hates. As Shirley MacLaine's character seeks answers through infidelity and anger, Ann Bancroft takes Shirley's daughter hostage, pets and spoils her - all to feed her own self-confidence.  Frankly, I think the cat fight on the roof is a wonderful scene, because finally, the two friends are able to show her fear and anger of being forgotten and growing old, and express their desire for something they can never have, for whatever reason, to each other. Watching Mikhail leap through the air is indeed a pleasure as well; but I personally enjoy his love scenes and Leslie Brown's long arms reaching to the sky as she falls in love with him.  It's a wonderful movie. See it, buy it, love it for what it is.",1

"never understood why girls would go to the gym and try out different exercises for a variety of reasons.

I had to get a girl to get the instruction booklet so I could go to the gym and look at the various exercises. The booklet was a little confusing to me. I knew I was looking at a girl and it seemed to me that the instruction booklet was a little more confusing than I expected. I tried to figure out how to get the instructions to work, but I couldn't do that because I couldn't see the instructions. I'm not sure why the booklet was so confusing to me but I thought maybe that was because it didn't work. I was a little frustrated by the booklet and thought that I could get it to work, but I couldn't because it was confusing. I also found that the booklet was not the easiest to read.

I would definitely recommend this necklace to anyone.  I am very pleased.I love this dress. The material is soft and comfortable. I love the color and the fit. I ordered a medium so I could wear it to work. The dress is a bit big on me but it fits well and is flattering. I have a short torso and the dress is a little too large for me. I am usually a size 6, but ordered a medium. The dress fits perfectly and looks great. It is a very cute dress.I'm 5'4"" and 140lbs, and ordered a medium for my nephew. He has a medium chest, but it's a bit too big. I wish he had worn a size smaller. I'm hoping the shirt will stretch a bit.My daughter loves these shoes. She loves them. They fit well, but",0

A nice light comedy that doesn't disappoint. The characters are believable and the acting is just as good. I had to watch this movie to get the full story. I enjoyed it.

"I liked how this story developed.  Rosalie Whitwell just wants a home of her own.  David Linney, Marquess of Deal, has spent his life being alone.  There are two tropes here.  David thinks he should not have children because he will pass a condition that runs in his family.  The other is the marriage of connivence.  Both work well in this story of two people who belong together.  The characters are well developed, the plot moves smoothly and the writing is excellent.

"Not quite as warm as I was expecting it to be. I'm a playground supervisor and am outside in ALL weather - wind, rain, snow.

I'm 5,4"" with a 31"" inseam and this hits just above my ankles.  I wear a 14/16US in jeans (depending in manufacturer) and the XXL fits over my jeans with a little room. I probably would have been fine with the XL. There are belt loops to snug it up if needed. There is a little elastic in the back waist.  The two way zipper runs from waist to the side kick pleat.

"I upgraded my Denon 2809CI for the SR5008.  The SR5008 chassis size is not as deep so it doesn't take up as much space on the shelf.  Since this is the bedroom I have a simple two channel setup with Axiom M60 floorstanding speakers and HSU Research STF-2 subwoofer.  I like the attention to detail such as the little vibration absorbing material (looks like Sorbothane soft rubber) on the feet to protect the electronics from the nearby subwoofer.

Previously I could not use Audessy with the older Denon because of the simple speaker setup.  Now with the Marantz SR5008 I was able to fly through the Audessy measurements and the sound difference is NIGHT AND DAY!  With the Audessy calibrated stereo setup, the sound is 3-dimensional and super clear.  I'm also selected the bi-amp option for the front speakers just to try it out (not sure if that makes a difference, but it's cool to have the option to put those extra Watts to use).  I would describe it as having a ""warm"" sound which I love.  I used to be a musician and I can distinguish subtle differences in sound quality.

The on-screen menu is very simple and easy to navigate.  When streaming Pandora Internet Radio, the song name and play timer is displayed on the Marantz portal window so I can still see the song name while the TV is turned off.  Some review on the web mentioned the lack of WiFi, but I think it would be silly to integrate WiFi into a high end AVR receiver because WiFi technology is changing so fast (802.11G, N, AC, etc. will be obsolete well before the receiver is outdated).  Simply get a tiny WiFi adapter such as the Netgear WNCE2001 or WNCE3001, plug it in and you're set for wireless as well.",1

"Basically this trap is a piece of folded cardboard with a sticky patch of goo on one side. You tear open a small plastic pouch to take out a little piece of white paper which is coated in the attractant, and drop it onto the sticky patch. The moths are supposed to fly into this little triangle area the size of a small slice of pie in search of the smell, and get stuck to the one sticky side. I guess it really depends on the types of moths you have floating around your house. We have the really tiny ones that come in from outside during spring and summer in California, and this didn't catch any of them. Hopefully that means they are not the type of moths that eat clothes.",1

"A great recipe book for anyone who wants to impress their family, friends, co-workers  (or themselves!) with delicious desserts. There's a lot to like about it. Here are my five reasons for giving it five stars:

1) An excellent introduction to the whole process of cooking caramel for those who are new to this delicious endeavor. Dennis Waller describes all the necessary equipment and provides helpful tips in his easy-to-read and easy-to-follow introduction.

2) All recipes follow the same format - and that's excellent because it helps those of us who have not done much with caramel before figure out what the main steps are in ALL caramel recipes. The same format makes these recipes easy to follow, thus, there's less likelihood of messing up.

3) I love the idea of adding some variety to the recipes, and Dennis Waller provides suggestions and options of what to change and how to change it. Love the idea of using spiced rum and Kahlua instead of vanilla! I'll just have to make sure I don't test-taste too much of either while cooking.

4) An excellent variety of recipes for different occasions, from more traditional to experimental.  Pumpkin Spice Caramel (and its Apple Spice version) and Spiced Pumpkin Fudge sound perfect for fall celebrations. Pecan Praline Caramel and Grandma Stella's Caramel would be great for the holiday season. The ones I'd like to try first are Spicy Chocolate Caramel made with Cayenne and Paprika peppers, Amaretto Almond Caramel, Bourbon Chocolate Pecan Caramel, and Chocolate Mint Fudge.

5) Pecan Pralines made with dried fruit deserve their own star!  Who wouldn't want to have dried mango, papaya, dates,  shredded coconut, or pineapple in their dessert. That will make it healthy, too. The five food groups, lots of fruit, and all that, right?",1

"This is a movie based on a controversial trial, where everyone's opinion then and now is already made and we all KNOW she was guilty of the conspiracy...  But was she?  This production will not answer the question, but takes the viewer, with our XXI mind through the trial process, the witnesses accounts and evidence presented at the trial.  we all know the story and the facts, but watching this movie is a great way to question the process, the fundamental principles of justice and the moral dilemma that the main character had to face - in real life.  This is movie shows us that the trial was as much about the conspirator as it was a trial of the defense lawyer and makes you ponder how would you have reacted if you were a juror? how about if you were the lawyer?
Besides the great content, the acting, direction, production, dialogue and photography are all 5-star!!",1

"The best thing about this DVD: a chance to be introduced to some of most wonderful music beyond the standard repertory.  As someone forever seeking something I haven't heard before, this score was something of a revelation.  And this is greatly to the credit of William Christie, and his superb group of singers (Piau, Naouri, d'Oustrac, Piolino, Lehtipuu) who were fully engaged and demonstrated that there is much fine singing beyond the Three Tenors world.

However: the staging is just soooo tiresome!  It starts off amusingly with white projections that end up built up like a three tier cake with dancers and singers coming and going through them.  Unfortunately then you realize that's all it's going to happen, with singers mainly in the forefront while all the dancing and projections are going on in the background non stop.  I'm sure in the theater this might have been very distracting.  On video at least the camera can focus mainly on the singers and ignore most of the extraneous business during their arias.

If you curious of the music you should seriously explore the music on CDs; however if this is your only option, view a borrowed copy to make sure you know what you're getting.  It ain't cheap.  Were it not for the wonderful music, I would have tossed it out long ago.",1

"Purchased this light for my high-tech planted tank before really doing much research. After using the light for a few weeks I've come to realize that it's not enough light for ""high-light"" plants. This model only puts out 20W which means that for a 20g tank you're still only getting 1W/gallon. CurrentUSA also claims a PAR reading of 100 in the center from 12"" above. Every single third-party test I've seen and read refutes this claim. The most I've seen from independent tests is about 65-70 PAR in ideal conditions. Not bad, but definitely not an honest description by CurrentUSA.

One other thing I really dislike about this light is the controller (the brains of the hardware). I really wish they would have integrated the controller into the housing unit of the light because it seems to always fall off my table and whenever I pick it up the buttons are so sensitive that one slight touch the lights will come on full blast in the middle of the night and startle my fish. The 24/7 feature is kind of nice and so is the dawn/dusk feature. I could have done without the gimmicky settings such as cloudy and lightning storm.

At the end of the day I ended up buying two units in order to get the PAR values that I needed for my tank. If you decide to do something similar just keep in mind that you cannot pair two units with one controller however you can use the same remote to control the two separate controllers. Overall  if you are looking for a low to mid light for around $100 (not sure why anyone would) then you may want to consider this light.",1

I find myself regretting this purchase. The quality is ok but it's not really the best one.I bought this for my son for Christmas and he absolutely loves it. The only thing that I do think is a little disappointing is that it is very thin and doesn't stay on very well. I think it's a bit too small for him to grasp on to and so far he hasn't had any problems with it. I think he will like it more as he gets older. Overall it is a great toy for the price.I bought this for my son who loves to build things and he has been doing it for a while now.  It's great that he can build something that he can do with no help from the boys.  I can't tell you how excited he is for this toy!

I never saw the original so I guess I don't have that to compare it to like most of the reviews on here. I thought it was a good movie for the most part.

"Editing original review
After about a year of use with the bulb I decided to give it a try. It is so bright that I am not using it in the dark, so it is not that bright. I have been using it in a dark room for about a year now. The light is so strong that it is blinding the most sensitive of the eye. It is bright enough to see in a dark room, but not so bright that it causes vision problems. It is very easy to adjust the brightness of the light. The light is very bright, which is why I put it in a dimmed light and put it in a dimmed light. I put it in a dimmed light and put it in a bright light. It does not interfere with the light setting I put it in. It has a good light, but it is not as bright as a dim",0

"I wish there was not an end to the ""Twilight"" saga.  This was the best series that I have seen by far.  I also feel this series followed the books closely and tried to put in as many aspects as possible.  My boyfriend and I went to see ""Breaking Dawn Part 2"" together in theaters.  He is not as into the saga as I am, he just goes with because I make him.  He enjoyed the crowd more than the movie.  He laughed at the crowd's reaction to Alice's vision. He said you could hear everyone sigh with relief.  I think this movie was great.  It always kept you on your toes, never knowing what to expect next.  After seeing this video in theaters I was extremely confused.  I loved how the movie took you off course, but I had a hard time keeping track of who was killed.  I was almost in tears seeing everyone get killed.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  This is one where I could watch it over and over and never get sick of it.  ""Breaking Dawn Part 2"" was the perfect ending to the story.  Knowing that Bella and Edward can finally live in happiness and peace together is elating.  I would highly recommend the entire series.  It might be about vampires and werewolves, but you have to look past that and catch the love story.",1

"It took me awhile before I really needed it, and it saved my vacation.  Firstly, when I received it (fast shipping) I mounted it under the water bottle cage and it fit in nicely.  Most of my friends didn't even know I had a pump with me.  I stashed all the other goodies in my bag guessing I wouldn't really need them.  I was wrong.  We took a trip to the upper area of Wisconsin in a location where the closest people are 10 miles or more apart.  As luck would have it, we broke down.  The car just stopped and later to find out it was a clogged fuel line.  So off comes bike and I'm ready to roll for help, but oops!  Flat tire!!!  No problem, I have a pump and it would have done a stellar job but I'm afraid it was the tube that burst.  UGH!  Thinking I couldn't do a repair in the woods I was wrong.  I had everything I needed to do the repair.  It was a life saver, because we were more than 20 miles from the nearest help.  The Mini bike pump worked great, I was even able to put in 55psi in my balloons.  Since then I used it just to top off, and it had worked great.  No issues.  Thanks Blanst!

"This makes a truly excellent cup of coffee or espresso - for one person. Probably you can't make a better cup given a particular roast of bean.  I just think it should be bigger.  We like strong coffee and a nice big cup of it. We make two big cups of coffee and we basically have to repeat the whole process twice. And if you have more people, well, I have other things to do with my day, just get out the old dripper I guess. If they made one twice as big I think it would be a huge improvement.

The key insight of this coffee maker is to use lots of coffee, let it soak in the water, and above all, do NOT get the water so hot. 160 or 170 degrees - you won't get the bitterness and off tastes as with hotter water. Now, using this insight, I have been able to use a drip basket instead of the Aeropress in a pinch, and get about the same quality a beverage. A lot of filter baskets taken out of drip machines have a little valve on the bottom so the coffee only drips out when a coffee pot is underneath. You can just put the filter and coffee and the not-too-hot water into this filter basket, and wait a couple minutes, then release the valve and let the coffee drain into a cup. Same quality as you get with an Aeropress, and it just proves that the not-too-hot water soak method is the key.

Frankly as they are not making a bigger model of this I think I will get a French Press. Use not-so-hot water, and make as much coffee as you need without going through the motions 2, 3, 4 times. I think the only problem with that is that a French Press does not have as fine a filter as the Aeropress and you will need to use a coarser grind of coffee or end up with a lot more sediment in your cup.",1

"Spider-Man 2 is better than the original Spider-Man. I feel I should get that out of the way first, since most sequels have a tough time topping the first one. However, I feel Spider-Man 2 is only better in the sense that if the same production staff remade Spider-Man, it should naturally be better. That's what this sequel feels like, a literal remake with some spiced up elements here and there. It's a good film, but it's not really the way I thought a sequel should be.

Effects are even better than the first, and the tentacles of Doc Ock make for some truly spectacular battles, including a centerpiece on a runaway train. Tobey Maguire continues to give an excellent portrayal of Peter Parker, and has good chemistry with Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane. Alfred Molina has more to work with as Doc Ock than Dafoe did as the Goblin, and humanizes what was once a wacky villain. James Franco continues to develop Harry Osborn well, and the supporting cast like JK Simmons and Rosemary Harris fill out the high-caliber acting.

But the script needs work. It uses one of the worst superhero cliches as the main plot, that of the hero calling it quits. It's never convincing, and the film drags as we wait for Peter to realize things we've known all along. Character relationships, though well-acted, don't seem to have progressed since the first movie. We're still treading the Peter/Mary Jane love triangle, just with a different third wheel. Harry still has his on/off friendship with Peter. There are nice plot twists that shake things up towards the end, but most of the film is wasted on the exact same angst from the first one. For a story supposedly set 3 years later, it might as well have been 3 days.

We get a dvd with good extras and audio/video presentation. I enjoy Spider-Man 2 on its own, and it's nice to have it in my dvd library, but as a sequel it's not fresh enough for me. Hopefully next year's Spider-Man 3 will fix that.",1

This is the 2nd or 3rd book I've read about America's wealthy elite and sadly, they all sound tragically alike. People without jobs and direction flounder to find purpose in their lives.

"As many other people have reported, the vinyl is nice and heavy and very white. 9' x 20' is a great size for my studio.
I did run into 2 things that I haven't seen mentioned:

1) The roll comes in a plastic bag which is inside a heavy round cardboard shipping tube. The problem was it was so tight in the tube that it took two of us 15 minutes of hard work to get it out! We had to use an empty core tube to push the roll out as it could not be pulled out by pulling on the plastic bag.
2) The cardboard core it's wrapped on is smaller than standard seamless paper cores so it may not fit your backdrop support depending on what you're using. I have one of these 3 roll wall racks and the roll fittings for it are too big to fit into the core of the vinyl roll.

The overall quality of this blade is astounding.  Buck never fails to deliver an awesome knife product.  This knife has quickly become my favorite hunting knife.

One day when I'm old I will be passing this blade down to one of my children.,1

"Lately I have been trying to put together affordable every day (EDC) pen lights among some other stronger lumen tactical lights for other applications. I recently bought the Milwaukee pen light and this Coast pen light to compare. This Coast Pen Light is definitely a focused light, just like its advertised, a focused light for closer ranges, because your beam makes a perfect circle, a perfect circumference, and the closer the object is the more intense the light is. The further you shine your light out, the bigger your circle gets and the weaker that intensity is; whereas with the Milwaukee pen light get a consistent brighter light no matter how far you shine it and you get a wider area of coverage. I can shine up my backyard pretty good with the Milwaukee light than the Coast Pen Light thats for sure.
Im glad I bought both lights to test out how I would use them when I needed too. They are both affordable and both are good lights, but out of the two, I would carry the Milwaukee everyday and leave my Coast light by my nightstand. To me, that is where the Coast Pen Light would come in handier, when you need to find something closer to you near in the dark. Now I am going to save up and purchase a bit more expensive rechargeable Streamlight Pen Light.
Another recommendation I would make is to invest in some really good rechargeable batteries, like the Panasonic Eneloop Pros and get yourself a smart charger as well, where you can make setting adjustment for your batteries and tests your batteries.",1

"Macy is bored of all the pitiful looks she receives due to her fathers death a year earlier. She and her mother have been getting along fine, just fine, on their own. Her mother constantly works, and Macy helps her by sticking to their routine and keeping a perfectly clean house. Shes content with her perfect boyfriend and perfect grades and perfect life. That is, until a hectic catering company enlists her help at one of her mothers work parties. She then realizes how exciting chaos can be and how interesting real friends are. I read this book for my Read-a-Thon at school and I finished it in the day. It contains some serious issues, but overall its an airy read. The issues aren't heart-wrenching nor are they abnormal, so the book is easy to relate to. I could complain about its predictability or sappiness, but The Truth about Forever is defintely a book about the journey. It doesnt matter that the reader knows within the first chapter that Macy will fall for the gorgeous catering guy, Wes. Or that the book will have pages about finding yourself, realizing happiness, and moving on. I knew coming into the novel this wasn't a heavy book, which is why I enjoyed it. Its entertaining, and thats why I like Dessens books. Always, she writes books that serve to entertain and relate to teens. I flipped happily through the pages, never bored, but never thrilled either. The characters are fun and normal and don't have anything special about them. Her books are so realistic. The world isn't going to end and the characters don't have anything life altering happen to them. She somehow writes about ordinary days but still engages the reader wholeheartedly. The Truth about Forever is a cute romance between two teens trying to find themselves. The plot isn't extraordinary, but the writing style and characters really make the book. Compared to the other Dessen books Ive read, this one isn't as good, but I still found myself entertained while reading it. More book reviews at Stealingpages.",1
"The World's End is a well-written action, middle-age life crisis, dark humored meets sci-fi film. The actors bring characters to life, making them believable. Like life, people aren't always what they seem; it's during crises that one's mettle is tested and who we are as human beings really revealed.

The movie isn't exactly what I thought it was going to be about, but was NOT disappointing in even a small dose! My teenagers caught some of the little ""pieces"" that relate to Simon Pegg's & Nick Frost's two previous films (""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz""), which sometimes only consisted of, say, a piece of wrapper.

The Special Features were enjoyable to watch. Seeing the actors not in character as they talked about the writing of the film, what their vision was, and how it came about was fun.

I'll not write a summary of the movie-- you can get that anywhere. But the summary of our family's view of this film: We loved it! If you like British humor, if you liked Pegg's other two movies, then you'll likely enjoy this film, as well. Very well written, interesting characters, nice approach to the mixed-genre subjects.",1

"Teva's Dozer shoes are, far from the best quality, and I will keep my feet in them for awhile.  I had to replace a pair of shoes that were not the same as these.  They had no arch support, which is a plus for me.  I ordered a half size up, which is a good thing because I'm getting older and having trouble getting shoes to fit.  I'm a 42D, so I'm on my feet all day long, so I don't have to worry about arch support.  I've had these for about a month now, and they're still really comfortable.  I do recommend getting a size up.  It's not just that I like these shoes, I also like the color and the way they look.  I will be buying more pairs of these shoes soon.Love the design of this shoe.  It is pretty.  I wear a 9.5 and I ordered a 9.5.  I normally wear a 9.5 and the 9.5 fit very well.  I have wide feet and this shoe does that.  It is a little bit snug in the toe box, but I think it will fit well.  I would recommend this shoe.I ordered this for my daughter.  She is a small girl and it fit perfect.  The length is perfect and the color is beautiful.  She loves it and wears it everyday.This is a nice shoe, great fit, good quality and very comfortable.  I'm 5'6"" and 125 lbs. I ordered a size up, and it fits.  She was so pleased with it. ",0
"1984 by George Orwell is a novel, with a distinctively dystopian plot that makes the reader feel as if they are the protagonists. The characters are complex, and the plots are very interesting.

The novel is in many ways a reflection of the American political scene. Its almost eerie, and a bit depressing at times, and it is a great way to introduce a new generation of readers to the subject matter of dystopian literature. But the novel is also an interesting introduction to a new generation of readers to dystopian literature. The novel is a fun, quirky read, with plenty of twists and turns.

In short, it is a fun, quirky read. It is a fun, quirky read. It is a fun, quirky read. It is a fun, quirky read. It is a fun, quirky read. It is a fun, quirky read. It is a fun, quirky read.

These work perfectly alone or joined together. The unit has a metal piece that is removable on the back so when you are taking your food out you can sit the lid on it.  Not needing to put it down on a counter.  Very easy to clean. Very well made nice quality construction.  The only negative thing I can say is on the dial there is only an indentation to mark if you have it on low warm or off.  I quickly resolved that by putting a little bit of white out in the indentation and that is working perfectly. These are available in different sizes. I have purchased many Bella products and I have always been completely satisfied. Always a good price for great quality.,1

This is a fun exciting story with amazing characters and world written by the author. She really know what she is doing with this series. Lots of twists and turns in this story as well as corruption. You just don't know who you can trust and who you can't. There are references to sex as well as sex scenes in this story.

"We bought this steam vac for my mother-in-law since my husband broke her other hoover steam vac. We're quite happy to hear that she liked this hoover steam vac because it is easier for her to use and it is lighter than the old one. So with this, I want to try the steam vac in my own house to see if it is worth owning one. So I tried to do my daughter's room. It cleans pretty well! I am quite surprised on how it was able to make the carpet look brand new. And it is dryer than the old hoover ( though I still add alcohol to the water when rinsing to help evaporation).

The only issue I have is that it is using a lot of detergent. After reading online if this is an issue, someone gave a really good idea. Just plain water in wash mode first. Then wash mode with detergent/solution. Then rinse.
 It seems more work but worth it. Just washing with water took out some of the dirt already. Then with detergent, the dirt were basically ready to come out. I rinse the carpet twice just to be sure it is soap free.

So I will definitely buy this one again. Very handy and easy to use.",1

We decided we use our toaster daily so why not try one that might cost a bit more but had great reviews. Our other toaster was a name brand- Cuisinart- but never toasted evenly and consistently. The first toast out of the Breville BTA830XL was toasted perfectly on both sides on all four pieces! The fact it can also toast long pieces is a plus when toasting a slice out of a large round loaf. Best one I have had in my lifetime!,1
It's a well-made toy but my 7 month old doesn't really care for it.  If I push the button she'll watch the balls move but it doesn't really hold her interest. Occasionally she'll just kind of pick it up and shake it. She's hit into it more times than she's actually played with it so it's probably done more harm than good in the 2 months I've owned it!,1

"I've only used this a few times, and I like it, but it has some idiosyncrasies.  The sizing is such that it probably fits a man better than a woman.  I""m 5'11"" with a 34 DDD chest and even with all the straps as tight as they can go, it's a little loose on me in places.  The straps run over my breasts which I find a little weird and was probably not intentional, as I think the fit is more for a man.  It's the perfect size storage-wise, fitting all the things I take with me (keys, cell phone, etc).  The pockets on the front are nice to have.  The water bladder is a good size if you won't be out too long.  I have a Camelback that's 2.0 liters I prefer if I'm out longer than an hour or two.  I would recommend it for an average to large man but I don't see how it would properly fit an average size woman.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my review.",1

They both have features I like and also things I think could be improved, but they don't shut themselves off every time the cat stops it like some do (a good thing!), and its very quiet except for an enticing little sound it makes sometimes, kind of like a squirrel chirping only not that loud. I wish they had a timer, and this second model would be nicer if it had a remote, because you have to push the button four times to go through all options when turning on or off.

"This is the first smart watch I've used, but I have been interested in trying one for a while now.  After using one I have mixed opinions on how useful it really is.

The first thing that struck me is that this thing is huge!  I've seen people wearing Apple watches, this is several times bigger and bulkier.  It came with a completely drained battery, which you have to partially charge to set it up.  The partial charge took 20-30 minutes.  My opinion is mixed on the charger.  It's handy not to have to plug a wire into the watch, as it's magnetic.  On the down side the watch has to be laid out flat to charge, so it takes up quite a bit of room.

Installing Android wear on my phone was easy enough.  The Michael Kors site did not work on my phone, but did work on my tablet.  I downloaded a few applications from Android to change the watch face, and check the weather.  It was fun to play with the different faces, there are a wide variety available for free.  The weather apps are also very useful.

The notifications are pretty cool, but are one of the reasons I question the usefulness.  So little text fits on the screen that I ended up going to my phone to read everything.  Similarly, setting up Google maps on the phone and then navigating from the watch is really only useful if walking, and I'd still rather see a larger map on my phone.  The Google translate is kind of cool, I've tried that out a couple of times converting to Russian and it works pretty well.

All in all I think this is kind of a niche product.  The size limits the market even more, as it's huge.",1

I was recommended to check out this book. I knew basically nothing about Norse mythology before reading this book. I enjoyed reading this book.  The author does a good job giving a general background and historical notes on the various gods. As a complete newbie to Norse mythology it was helpful and made for an enjoyable experience. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn more about Norse mythology.,1

It appears to be waterproof/resistant but I haven't tested it yet. The 3 compartments are very useful for items quickly needed such as flashlights first aid kits etc. I did have to adjust the belt/chest straps a little but afterwards it fit perfectly. I've read reviews stating that it only fits larger people which is not true. My waist is 32"" and it fits perfect. Only minor thing was the drawstring which was a quick fix.

"This is a classic read for me as it was my first fantasy novel. Hence it is a classic novel for me and very sentimental. I recently hunted down a reprint as I had lost a large volume of my original reads and re read the book. The story is a light fantasy read, but extremely entertaining. The plot and characters are creative, and the writing is descriptive and enjoyable. Lawrence portrays the main character as distinctly human in his attributes and flaws which is a breath of fresh air from other novels. Presenting a character that could be you or me or anyone, thrust into an adventure unwillingly and forced to play the cards as fate deals them. I also enjoy Lawrence' very non-linear and unorthodox story lines. He's very creative with coming up with non-traditional fantasy elements and weaving them together into a very solid story. You can see more of this in his other novels such as ""cyborg and the sorcerers"", or the overman series, but also here as well. I recommend this novel to anyone.",1

"When I saw this DVD I thought it might be good with Penn directing and the cast, but now I can see why I do not recall seeing its trailer at a theatre or on my tv screen....
The dialogue is badly muddled some of the time.....e.g. when Frank and Joe are alone on the porch of their old farm and running around in the corn field......Another instance is when Joe goes to the bar to see why Frank is not at home where his child is being born.
There is also a tendency to leave things hanging.....
I found it a waste of some talented actors e.g. Bronson, Hopper, Denis and others, but admit that it is probably the best thing that Morse has ever done on the big screen...normally he walks thru his roles like a zombie.
I found Mortensen's character, Frank, to be sad and compelling, but the others were fleeting in time and depth.
Finally, are we to believe that after Frank beats the bartender to death, that his brother, a dedicated police officer, just sighs and tells us that he never saw him again? He is of course not aware of the other things he has done before he hit town but this is a problem that does not deserve a slap on the wrist and a sad farewell, no matter if he is his brother or not.

I really disliked the character of Genet and the brothers' relationship with her was just too ridiculous for me. I thought she was gone for good and then .... I will say no more- don't want to ruin it for anyone reading this book. And it is well worth reading -I just wish it had ended sooner without all the unnecessary plot ""twists"" in the end.

"I got this as a Christmas gift for my wife after one of the grandkids broke the screen on her last one.  Not very pleased with the quality of the cameras or the screen resolution but it does what she wants it to do. The colors are great it's just a little grainy if your looking at pictures or watching a video and the pictures from the camera are very grainy.  This was a disappointment to her because she likes to take it when we go hiking and use it for pictures.  This one won't work well for that due to poor camera quality. I wanted to get the same one she had but couldn't find it on amazon.  Maybe they don't sell it anymore.  The tagital seems to respond fast enough for browsing the net and playing her games.  The touch screen is sensitive enough.  We only had one issue after a few hours.  It worked great with the included keyboard at first then last night it wouldn't boot up, kept getting an error message.  Then we unplugged the keyboard and it booted correctly.  Haven't tried the keyboard again to see if it was a fluke or the keyboard actually went bad.  The included case is very nice and I like the way the tablet actually is snapped in place.  Much more secure than the one she had with her other tablet.  For the price I paid we are not overly disappointed.  In short if you want to just browse or play games buy it.  If you want to take pictures and watch videos I'd look else where.  This is the first thing I've purchase through Amazon that I wasn't 100% happy with.",1

So what is this good for? If I need a little night lite I can turn this on and not worry about waking up my wife where my iPhone may be a little too bright.

None of them were significant to the story or the meaning of a sentence, just small things like using the wrong tense, the wrong spelling for sound-alike words, or leaving out or adding in extra words incorrectly.  These errors should have been proof-read out before publishing ... and I'm disappointed they weren't.

I still recommend this story if you enjoy a good storyline with some delicious intimate scenes, a H who's a little, I mean a lot, rough around the edges and a sweet and mature h.  Both are beautiful, inside and out, if a little broken by their life experiences.  Which is a great segue to the beautiful cover ... WOUZA! ... that is a scrumptious match to Evie's description of Daryk.  Love when the cover art actually depicts a physical likeness to the character in the book, even down to the tats. Now I guess it's time to admit that I stopped reading several, ok - lots of, times to 'refresh my memory' LOL!",1

"Volume 2 will continue the chronological release of the early sound Our Gang (Little Rascals) comedies from 1930 & 1931:
A Tough Winter
Pups Is Pups
Teacher's Pet
School's Out
Helping Grandma
Love Business
Little Daddy
Bargain Day
Fly My Kite
Big Ears

Jackie Cooper shines here as he falls for his teacher Miss Crabtree and has to compete with Chubby Chaney in ""Teacher's Pet"", ""School's Out"" & ""Love Business"".
Wheezer takes the main stage in ""Pups IS Pups"" but the early gang is all there as they invade an animal show with their exotic pets.
The gang's love for an elderly lady who acts as their Grandmother is heartwarming yet great fun in ""Helping Grandma"" & ""Fly My Kite"".
One clinker here is ""Big Ears"" which is a melodrama dealing with divorce.

Over all Volume 2 is much stronger than Volume 1, it is apparent that the Hal Roach Studios have become comfortable with their new sound apparatus and can now focus on producing funny comedies again.

For those looking for Spanky, he will not turn up until Volume 3.

"Given that fifteen of the sixteen previous customer reviews have contained cogent and quite articulate praise for Professor Fussell's book, my praises may seem redundant.  However, this is such a brilliant and important book that I am compelled to write about it.
  I have been obsessed with The GW&MM since I first read it in 1978, so obsessed that I have read it many times.  Each time I read it new ideas and new authors spring out of the text and send me to the library or bookstore.  Fussell's prose is captivating, and his scholarship is breathtaking in both breadth and depth.  My first reading of The GS&MM was in Belgium during a Sabbatical year in Brussels.  Our son was writing a senior ISP on the effect of the German invasion on Belgium, and we went to Ypres as part of the research.  We were both overwhelmed by the 105 Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries there, and reading The GW&MM during that period helped to put these beautiful and touching burial grounds into the context of the mud and stink that was the Salient during (and for several years after) 1914-1918.
  Prof. Fussell introduced me to Graves (my favorite) and Sassoon and Blunden and David Jones and Wifred Owen and opened the door to these wonderful novelists and poets for a biochemist without much appreciation of British literature.
  The GW&MM presents an amazing constellation of knowledge and understanding and compassion for the victims of WW I, and my recommendation of this masterpiece is totally enthusiastic and without reservation.",1
"Purchased these as a bundle with a black light flashlight.  They work well thou they don't fit over my fat head very well.  Have put these over the lenses of the black light when on a florescent stain and they do block enough that you cant see the stain any longer.  Have also discovered that having these on stops my Transitions lenses from darkening when outside.  Not blown away since they don't fit over my head well, but they do exactly what is advertised.",1

"I received my set fast and it was well packaged.  The set comes in a pretty blue that brightens up your kitchen.  The handles are see through plastic with a nice hole for hanging.  The brush has a white handle and the silicone bristles are blue.  The brush head removes for easy cleaning and is very durable and works great at spreading the BBQ sauce.  I have used other silicone brushes before but they did not come apart and they would get built up discoloration or food particles where the head connected to the handle.  The brush head stays on very well during use also.  The spatulas are all well attached and no matter how hard I pulled them they did not loosen or pull off the handles.  I have had so many of the rubber or silicone spatulas pull off and its so aggravating.  They handles are large and sturdy and very easy to grasp and use.  They are easy to clean and I just throw my in my dishwasher. My favorite feature is unlike the rubber spatulas these don't stain or at least mine have not yet and I use them daily. My set came with a small spatula that measures 9 inches long and the spatula head is 2 3/4 long and 1 3/8 wide.  The medium spatula and spoon are 10 inches long and measure 3 1/4 long and around 2 1/2 inches wide. Perfect for your everyday cooking or baking needs.

"Loved the movie, but it left a bad (director (Besson), and so called visual effects) after taste.
The first BIG downer, was when Lucy was repeatedly kicked in the stomach by a drug czars henchmen, when they knew the very expensive drugs where inside her belly; REALLY?  The next blunder was on the part of the so-called visual effects people (there were a few of them to blame), when they used the old roll the room effect that is so old and lame, that nobody uses it anymore. REALLY?
I found the effects (or the lack of) the most offensive part of the movie, especially the growing black computer fingers; REALLY?
Not a bad movie with a 40mil budget/88 min running time, and I am sure Scarlett and Morgan got a large share of it, as it was not well spent on the production.
Compare this with the 2012 The Avengers, at 220mil/143 min running time, and you can see it was a low budget film from the start, and for that reason, they actually did a pretty good job.",1
"4. 5 STARS

There are 4 Alpha male characters, each with their own unique personality, that I found particularly interesting. The story is told from both the POV of a female character and the POV of a male character. The alpha male is a strong, alpha man who has been given the female name after his family's death and is also a military man who has been given the male name. He has had to face his own demons and go through some difficult times, but he does not want to let his feelings for the female lead get in the way of his personal happiness. The main character, Asher, is a recovering alcoholic who is not only struggling to get back into her life but is also having a difficult time adjusting to life in the military. Asher is a good student and a good friend to Asher, who is a military man. Asher's friend, Aria, is the widow of a service member.",0

"Majority Rules Card Game by Flat River Group is an interesting party game on an original premise. The rule is pretty simple. Players pick five candidates, real or fictional, at the start of the game. The chairperson then picks a question card from the pile and reads it out. Players vote for the candidate to whom they think the question is most applicable. The majority wins. All players start with 10 points each and would bet 1-3 points based on how confident that they would win the round. Most of the questions are edgy and ludicrous. How fun the game would be largely depends on the initial selection of the five candidates and how the players would go all out on a debate and defend their votes. If you have a good mix of candidates and a group of imaginative and outspoken players, the game is gonna be fun and awesome. If not, you will very soon find the group ready to move on.

Although this may be a fun and ludicrous party game, some of the questions presented tend to be adult only (sex related). As such, I'm seriously doubt that the age 14 and up rating from the manufacturer is appropriate. I would personally remove those questions before passing it to my teenager when he has his friends over. The game comes with everything you'll need such as a dry erase board and pen for writing the five candidates down, 1-2 point chips for betting and spinners for selecting your own vote.",1

I love the color, the color is not as bright as I was expecting it to be, but I really like the color of the bowls. I love the fact that the bowls have a handle that doesn't slide off the bottom of the bowl. This allows you to just pour coffee or tea into the bowl with ease.

"Cass is a single mother as a result of a one night stand.

Logan was the one night stand.

Now a twist if fate has them meet up again in somewhat secret circumstances.
Cass is Logans boss but she has no clue about his secret that could change everything.

This book started off at a steady pace, then it slowed down in the middle and hit it's stride again in the last 3rd.

Cass and Logan are both head strong and career driven. They have different experiences in life and this shows in each interaction they have. Because of the complexity of their situation there are a lot of undercurrents in their conversations, but only one of them is aware of it.

The author has done a good job showing the different sides to her characters personalities. The chemistry between Logan and Cass never diminishes and the love they have for their daughter despite the intricacies they face shines through and comes above everything else.

I enjoyed this story. The characters and the storyline is consistent and interesting and I liked the dynamics of the other relationships each Cass and Logan have with others such as Logan's grandmother and Cass's friend Patricia. Those relationships added another layer and also a bit of lightness to the storyline.

This is a great holiday read and worth one clicking if you like a good romance!

"This is one of the few times amazon reviews have let me down. I bought this to have on hand whenever I made my own dressings or sauces that might be used over the course of a few days. My bottle got pushed towards the back of the cupboard and I forgot about it, until I moved and decided I should make use of it since I finally had space for everything.

The first time I went to use it, however, liquid droplets went flying everywhere with the first few shakes! I thought maybe the lid wasn't tight enough, but it still leaked. I held down the flip cap, but still wound up with ingredients running down my arm. It was such a disappointing mess, and the bottle wouldn't exactly look right or be any more functional than any other bottle sans crappy screwtop that I just threw it away (a rarity for me, since I hate throwing away things.)

I was pretty shocked at how useless it was since I remembered the glowing reviews my fellow Amazonians had given it, and because I have other Norpro products that are fairly above-average in terms of functionality and usefulness.

The bottle's looks were pretty plain and utilitarian but I'd overlooked that for the sake of function, but now I think next time I'd prefer a prettier bottle even if it doesn't have useful features like a screw-on lid or flip top cap, since they could likely just be made of fail anyway.",1

"LOVE THIS COVER!! The quality is excellent and I love that it covers not only the back seat, but also the sides of the back seat, the floor, and the backs of the front seats. Before I got this cover, I had old blankets trying to protect my leather seats from 2 large labs!  And any other covers I purchased didn't fit well and ended up useless.  It has great coverage, awesome high-quality material, and is easy to install. Can be done in 5 minutes, or even less if you are in a rush and you skip some of the steps that fully secure it. There are many straps, buckles, ties, and fittings that attach it around headrests (rear seats and the front seats), tie around the seat belts, and fabric fittings that are meant to slip in the back of the seat and the sides of the vehicle as well as between the bottom of the seat and the back of the seat so that it does not slide around too much. It fits well in my Lexus ES350.  This does the trick of protecting the leather from their nails.  I especially like the generous flap that connects to the front seats and then hangs down to the floor to keep their hair contained, instead of flying all over.  I ordered the grey even thought my interior is tan.  I couldn't tell if I would like the tan shown in the pictures and I also have grey in other areas of my car so it blends well.  It was very easy to install but haven't figured out how to get the back of it to stay in place better but I feel like there is a way with a little help from my husband.  The main function is to keep the seat protected from their nails since I have the perforated leather that can easily be torn. I would definitely recommend!

"I have had this saw for a number of years. I am primarily a carpenter but dabble in a lot of crafts for the sake of expediency and simply out of acquiring a skill in a variety of types of work.  If I had it to do over again I would not buy a bridge-type saw. The concept seems good but in reality, the design just doesn't provide the kind of sawing control needed to cut tile accurately.  The blade cannot be moved smoothly across tile the way it can on saws where the blade remains fixed and the bed holding the material moves INTO the blade.

The slated fixed aluminum base also creates a rather slippery platform for wet tile. Some type of backstop to prevent the material from shifting is needed and the inferior design and cheaply built T-square provided just isn't adequate.  It simply does not provide adequate control of the cutting process.

You would think that the extended length of the box like construction would provide ample space for long cuts on larger tiles but the bridge arms are inevitably in the way of most cutsforget doing diagonal cuts on larger tiles.

Besides an inferior design, the unit is cheaply made with poor welds and rough finishes that do not hold up well. The water reservoir and pump produces a sloppy mess that can be generally be avoided with other style saws.  The motor is also a bit underpowered but nonetheless has continued to run with regular use.

Don't let the quirky design lure you in. Look to more basic type tile saws.",1
"Seems to work well.  I bought it for a camera that had been modified for astrophotography work.  It takes care of the color change that modification causes, and does it without having to mess with the white balance settings.  Makes the camera useable for normal (non-astro) photographs.",1

"I want to give the dog a freebie and thank you for your help. I have a lab mix and we had a lot of fun with him! He loves to take it off and go somewhere. It's a good size for a small dog. This is a great size for a large dog. I have a German Shepherd and a medium-sized dog. I've had great success with my dogs. They are able to go outside on their own with me, and they have not shown any digestive issues. I'd recommend this product.My cat loves it",0

I actually bought this at a local hardware store and it was a nice piece of equipment.  It is so small that it would be impractical to carry around with me in a pack.

"The short stories of ""The Academy"" & ""Third Watch"" are best read before any of the Tracy Crosswhite novels. Both are short introductions to the character and explain why she decided to give up her profession to be a cop. Both are only 45-47 pages, yet both have a good deal packed into a short space. Each short stands alone as Mr. Dugoni carries a separate plot in each. Together, they make for a novel and complete introduction to the main and supporting characters. ""Academy"" should be read first, then ""Third Watch.",1

"I get baffled by reviewers who say the pieces are just too small. They are tiny and we have yet to find a piece that is too small to fit into the box. We bought this for our toddler and it's perfect for him. He loves it. It's a bit smaller than I expected it to be but he's not too big so I'm sure he'll enjoy it. I think it's nice to have an assortment of different toys for him to play with. My son is so excited about this, he loves it, and is still learning and building it. It is definitely a hit with my son and he loves it!I bought these as Christmas gifts for my granddaughter, who has a lot of fun with them. I was very disappointed with the quality of the little pieces. I thought the wooden pieces were a bit too small for her. I would not have bought them for her in the future. So far, she loves them. My daughter is 4 and has had them for about a month now and they are so well made! I would have paid more for these. They are well made and very cute. I would recommend for anyone!This is a great toy! My son loves it!My grandson loves it!  He's a little taller than I thought he'd be, but he is still pretty much the same size as the other kids we've played with. So, I'm pleased with the quality of the product. He's actually pretty happy with it, but I think it's a little too small for him to play with.",0

I am very happy with this purchase.I just bought a new laptop and I am extremely happy with it. It's very easy to use and very easy to navigate. The only thing I wish I could add is that the design of the keyboard is very nice. It is really difficult to find a keyboard with such a small size on the market.

Now that I have used this tool, I feel confident that it will hold up well.  The other two I had to replace, both with the same plastic handle.  I used this to hold up the smaller drill bits in a bit holder.  This holds the drill bits in the bit holder.  I also like the fact that the plastic handle on the drill bits has a plastic handle on top.

"When I got the socks, I was pleasantly surprised to find that they came as a set of two pairs! This, combined with the price (I paid about $7), makes them a very good deal. The socks themselves feel pretty good. I haven't worn them out yet (giving them a try this weekend) so I've left it at 4 stars until I get a chance to.

Update (5 stars):
I've just taken the socks out for an 11 mile hike across rocky terrain in 80F weather. The socks performed really well. They felt comfortable in my boots and were thick enough to keep any blisters forming. I was a bit apprehensive about wearing wool in summer, but I found that they did not feel too hot at all. On the contrary, they kept my feet pretty dry, especially compared to the cotton socks that I normally wear, which normally make my feet feel like they are swimming.

I've also given them a wash in the machine, and they don't seem to have shrunk.

All in all, I feel quite happy about this purchase. I've already recommended them to my hiking buddies.",1

I watched it twice and the second time around, It made more sense and I could see more of the connections between the stories and the characters.  I think if I watched it again, I would be able to follow the story even better. The futuristic story of  Sonmi~451 and Hae-Joo Chang is my favorite.  It's such a powerful love story of two people from different worlds who come together to fuel a revolution. They find love and, in the end, sacrifice themselves for the cause. I also found the character of ""Old Georgie"" from the last story very haunting and entertaining.

"With 13 cats; this is a must-have in our house. I've read negative reviews, the problem being they are using the wrong product. There are two: Feliway Comfort Zone and Feliway with CEVA. The Comfort Zone is good for mildly nervous cats. You need the Ceva for aggression, spraying and other behaviors of this type. For those who complain that it doesn't last 30 days; buy a timer. We have an atomizer in every one of our 14 rooms. We have them all on a set up of 'one hour on; 4 hours off', it makes them last much longer and they are still very effective. All of our cats have been abused, abandoned or something equally upsetting. Bringing a new cat with issues into a house full of cats with issues would be impossible without this product.

"The stainless steel is easy to disassemble and clean; it does not absorb bacteria like plastics.  I chose this one because stainless steel is healthier than plastics, and it looks better in my kitchen - like a sculptured water fountain.

After running it for the first time, after a few rotations of water, any residual rubber or machine smells will be gone, as the first reviewer/most helpful reviewer mentioned.

Simple Maintenance is key:

If the motor and pump are disassembled and cleaned properly, you won't need to replace them; you'll only need to replace filters, which are reasonably priced and well worth it.
If you don't clean the motor and  pump well enough or often enough, you will have to purchase a new motor and pump from the Pioneer Pet website (at least they sell it separately, though it's pricey enough to make you think about getting a second fountain.  Maintenance is key to getting 5 star use of this product and keeping its economic value.)

My cat has allergies and urinary tract infection tendencies; water is so important for her to prevent these issues.  She drinks the most from this fountain, laying next to it and sopping it up for minutes, than she ever did from the 2 plastic ones we had before (and eventually stopped working).  This fountain has helped keep her healthy, she's so hydrated.

It's very quiet and will only get noisy if you let the water level fall below the motor's line.  The noisiness is a sound of the motor's slow death - keep that water filled.

Take care of this product (and it doesn't take much; there are easy instructions, even online videos), and your pet will love you for it.  We've had this fountain 2 years this spring. She looks at me with ""I love you"" after I gave it to her the first time, and after I clean it (every week the bowl @ 5 mins, every month all parts @20 mins).  We both love this fountain. 5 Stars.",1

For our purposes, this is ok, at least for now. My school-age child just wants a basketball-like activity for indoors. But sooner or later, the kids are going to turn it into a contact sport, and i expect to be able to re-assemble the rig a few times before a piece finally breaks.",1

The Fugitive had pixel problems in all players and the same happened to the unforgiven. the only movie that was OK was The Last Samurai.

"I purchased this nailer after my Dewalt 18v finish nailer decided to take a vacation. I install doors for a living, and needed a nailer with enough stank behind it to countersink nails through 5/4 material. I almost purchased a new Dewalt but this Ryobi had decent reviews, a comparable warranty, but a much better price point. All of my hand tools are Ryobi so I had more than enough batteries/chargers on hand. My experience with Ryobi tools has been a positive one. I'm extremely rough on my equipment, and they have all held up to the beating. Anyway, this nailer is OK. If you're using it for the occasional project, and don't mind having a few floating nails, it'll do just fine. This nailer however, did not meet my expectations. Didn't matter if I was using 2 inch nails or 2 1/2....didn't matter if I was nailing into a low profile interior trim, or thicker 5/4 material...didn't matter if I had the depth as deep as it would go and the compression gauge all the way to max...didn't matter how I held the gun against the material...it just wouldn't countersink the nails consistently. Maybe 6/10 successful countersinking. That meant more time manually punching nails and filling holes. Another issue I was having was the constant ""skipping"" off the nail head causing basically 2 holes to puddy AND the nail head was not countersunk. That didn't happen too often, but it was enough to make me say aloud, ""what the???"" The price listed above is insane- I picked up mine at the Home Depot for $200. It's possible I just had a defective product, because all the other reviews I've read were glowing for this exact same product. It's possible it was defective, but it's possible the next one will be too- so I'm going to purchase the newer Senco F16. Same conveniences, still less than Dewalt, and looks like a space-gun.
I gave it 2 stars because I still love Ryobi, and other than this experience- their other tools have stood up to my wrath.",1

"I simply can't understand the vitriol that has been heaped on this movie.  I didn't see Alexander in the theatre, so my only experience with it is the director's cut DVD, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  Oliver Stone brought Alexander and his times to life for me, and Colin Farrell did an excellent job putting a human face on a man who thought he was a god.  Don't be put off by the jabs of spoiled movie critics - watch this lavish and engrossing film, and enjoy!

The only flaw I saw with the film - and it may be an insurmountable one - is that so much went on in Alexander's life, that it is probably impossible to present it all in a single movie.  Stone gives us a glimpse into the political, military, and personal aspects of Alexander's story, and these really can't be fully appreciated unless one has first familiarized oneself by reading the various accounts of Alexander, especially those written by his ancient biographers.  I may be reading too much into it, but I think the central theme of the Stone film is given us when, on Alexander's wedding night, he responds to his new bride""s question about whether he loves Hephaestion by saying, ""There are many kinds of love, Roxane.""  Oliver Stone's Alexander has many loves - his father, his mother, Hephaestion, Bagoas, the army, glory, war, his vision of a united world empire - and his attempts to give full devotion to each one drive his extraordinary career and, it would seem, eventually lead to his own self-destruction.",1

"A longtime fan of the author, I was thrilled to see this book in the Vine program. I love Gabby's upbeat, positive, yet no-nonsense and very realistic voice. She tells it like it is, breaking down her lessons, and her life, into small meaningful chapters which pull the reader in and carry him or her through to the lesson and the meaning. This book isn't the ""pollyanna think and you'll be happy"" refrain that some authors offer. Instead, Gabby brings you into the harsh light of day, giving real life examples to the lessons, and honestly, and sometimes painfully sharing aspect of her life which a lesser person might have kept hidden.

Gabby is an inspiration to all of us spirit junkies out there, the meaning to keep trying and carry on, yet she challenges the reader to change, to look at her life in a new way, and in the end, Spirit Junkie will take the reader on a journey of introspection, transformation, and love.",1

Nor is this boy just a genius, but also is one the worlds most wanted crimnals, to humans and fairies alike. And he just cracked the code.

"We've all seen it...the mess in the trunk or under the seat.  For some reason wires just naturally find their way into nots, and having big heavy cable clamps on the ends doesn't help matters much.  Add to that the fact that your car won't start and your mood is deteriorating fast!  It's a recipe for disaster!  Well no longer!  Some finally invented something to save us from our frustrations.  The Arsenal cable organizer.

I bought a set of 25' Coleman 4ga Booster Cables with it and they fit without a problem!  So just about any jumper cable size and length combo should prove to work as well.  There are two sleve style compartments on the sides.  Good perhaps for a set of flat tools such as a wrench or plyers or good for gloves.  The stiching on the handles is top to bottom so I don't fear those coming loose.  The zippers are good heavy stock so they should last as well.

One more word of advice save the twist ties that come with your cables, and if they don't come with them get some.  Twist tying them before storage will help the bag keep them nice, neat, and flat.  And the bag will keep those monster clamps from hooking everything around them!

Update: I just bought a second bag and a set of Coleman 25' 2ga cables.  They fit great!  So buy this bag with confidence for just about any cable size and length combo you can find!!!",1
"Even though I'm giving this four stars, part of me isn't sure I did like it very much - but that's not because Roberto Saviano's brutal and intense story wasn't interesting (via what seems a very good translation). Mostly, it's because of the nihilism of the cocaine industry, and the pointlessness of trying to do much about it. The cartels have all the power, and the money is so huge that of course they will do anything to maintain it - and frankly, banks probably depend on the cash infusions as well.

So what we're left with is a grim, brutal and horrible look at an industry that does infect our lives probably more than we like to admit. But what can we do about it? Not much. And is being educated/informed about it worth reading about it? I'm really not sure. I feel like I generally knew most of what Saviano wrote about so ably, but he certainly rubbed my nose in these gruesome stories. Is that a good thing? And why? I don't know if I have an answer for that!

I respect Saviano going all-in with this story, though, and just having this book out there is important. So even if a reader is turned off by these horrible stories, at least they have been told. So I don't need to like the story - and I think a reader should just respect the story. As long as that's accomplished, the book did its job - it shouldn't be be 'fun and glamorous' and it is not.

Readers of criminal justice will appreciate this - especially fans of true crime accounts (which I'm generally not, I have to say), so it absolutely has an audience. I'm giving it four stars with some general reservations, but with a solid appreciation for the take-no-prisoners account that Saviano has provided. He hammers the topic home, and it takes all the glamour out of the drug, that's for sure.",1

- - - Notes - - -

Note 1: Apple products use their own rules to decide charging speed. A designed-for-Apple charger may be slow to charge non-Apple devices, and vice versa.

Note 2: Blocking other outlets. Seems like small thing, but it can be a hassle. Unplugging hotel room lamps, alarm clocks, etc. to charge your phone? Just say no (or carry an extension cord).

"Best lovey ever!  We received as a gift when our daughter was born.  Since she has loved dogs since she could lift her head, it immediately became her favorite soft toy.  She is 2 now and carries it with her every where.  To daycare, for a car ride, to the store, Grandma's....every where.  She left it at her Nanny's once.  That was a difficult night.  I'm going to order a second so that we can rotate.  It's very hard to get the pink doggie washed. My daughter doesn't let it out of her sight very long.  It has worn well.  Washes great.

"I have no way of knowing whether any of the statements of facts introduced into this book are true.  Is it true that in the Arctic a drowned body will never come to the surface because there is no microbial activity to release oxygen to make the body float?  Is it true that there is an intestinal worm related to the guinea worm that lives only in sea mammals? Is it true that the ice from congealed fog is more dangerous to a ship than the ice from snow or rain?  Here is a whole universe of knowledge which comes handed to the reader on a platter, the understanding of which becomes the difference between death and survival.

Smilla, of course, being half Inuit and half Danish polymath, understands this universe.  In fact, she understands it much better than she understands the world of Western civilization represented in this book by metallurgy, medical research, and money.  She is drawn into this world by another element she barely understands  love.  She has learned to love a child, and the child is dead.  Was it an accident?  Because of what Smilla knows about the boy, and about snow, she is pretty sure it was not.

Smillas  exploration into what really happened leads her to danger, anger, passion, revenge, greed, torture, several icy plunges into freezing water, and lots of explanations about ice.  This is a good book to read next to a crackling fire with a cozy afghan around your knees.  Not so good if you are on a cruise to Greenland.

As I was thawing out mentally from the vast empty ice floes of northern Greenland where the novel played out its last pages, I began to see a few areas in the plot where Hoeg was skating on pretty thin ice.  But while I was reading, they didn't show, and even after, they didn't matter much.  Smillas cold universe was amazingly real, whether it was true or not.",1
"Seneca of Cordoba, Spain is a real genius.  Her characters are complex, beautiful, and full of self-effacing humor.  There is also a mysterious, sadistic, and yet romantic side to her.  She is a very likable character with an excellent sense of humor.  I especially liked the fact that she has a sister who is a very successful writer.

"For the untrained Clive Barker reader, Abarat will seem like a vivid dream, an elaborate creation, a thing of wonder and beauty to be praised and revered. To the serious Clive Barker reader, it amounts to the PG-13 version of Weaveworld and imajica combined. Clive has taken to the all-ages genre and created a series that is sure to make him richer than he already is, but he's not doing anything new and that is very frustrating for the Constant Reader. Abarat is a story about Candy Quackenbush who lives in the dullsville town of Chickentown, Minnesota. She is an outcast, an exile, and she can't wait to get away. Well. as you guessed, adventure finds her and she winds up in The Abarat, a series of islands in the nether world each dedicated to a certain our of the day or night. Yawn. Very formulaic for Barker. This is Clive on cruise control. This is Clive on auto-pilot. This is Clive writing for the sake of writing, being weird for the sake of nothing better to do. Clive Barker is good at being outlandish and strange and thinking up attorcities and oddities is his modus operendi. Get a clue. This is nothing new.",1

"Meet Jordan a sassy girl that cant be touched by a male, without flipping out. Meet Blake a very rich not so stuck up guy that has a goal and it happens to be Jordan. What a fun love story this is!! Thinking her ""love"" life is done and over, Jordon isn't ready for her reaction to Blake. Upon meeting him she is rude and outright mean to him. It will take a stronger man to keep coming back to a girl for all intent and purposes beyond crazy. Blake sees something in Jordan and vows that he will get her for himself.
Of course I so fell in love with Blake. The way he handles Jordan is amazing, He doesn't let her run away. She gets so busy fighting her past shadows she misses the fact that she is falling for Blake. All the back peddling she continues to do, Blake just seems to stay close to her. Jordan strength is in that she has moved on from her pain to become who she is. Blake even his background doesnt define who he is. Giving Jordan the time she needs was prolly the biggest thing to help her over come her own demons.
The sex is soo shower worthy. (smiles) some had me even squirming. The first time they are together how he tells her to keep her eyes on him. He chased her shadows away. Opening her future and helping with her past, with patience and showing Jordon she isn't just a booty call.
I really loved all the characters in this book. His parents, Dacy her BFF. This is one of a very few that made me cry happy tears. A job well done to the author.

"Ana has a problem. She has been pregnant and has no idea how to give birth. When she arrives at the hospital, she is told by the nurse that the baby is going to be born. It takes a little while for her to realize what is going on. She gets a call from a nurse and is immediately interested in the baby. There is a lot of potential here for a romance between a nurse and her baby. I loved the way the story went about this mystery. The romance was believable, but the pregnancy was not as great as the other two. I would like to see more of a storyline between the two of them. I found myself wanting more and was a little disappointed. There were too many spelling and grammar errors and I was a little confused at the end. I would have liked to see more of the story. I really enjoyed this book. It's a quick read. I can't wait for the next book in this series. I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

"Combing the mythological stories of the Argonauts, with futuristic genetic manipulation, Kneupper has crafted an exciting sci-fi tale that reimagines an old story in a fantastic new way.
 Following the adventures of Jason, a super-soldier and product of the genetic code enhancements provided by Argo Corp, and genomancer Medea, Argonauts is faced paced, without skimping on immersive world building or short changing the plot.
 Argonauts is well-written clear, clean prose, strong characterization, and page turning action sequences. It is sure to be a welcome addition to the reading shelf of fans of Sci-fi, and bio-genetics in particular.
 My only criticism of this book is that I would have liked to see Medeas personality be a bit stronger. Im assuming shell have a growth arc later on, as it set up well for her to snap out of her lovesick behavior pattern. Her personality made the book read more like a YA to me, which may or may not have been his intention. Either way, could completely be a set up for future installments.",1
"For once, I did know the mystery since the beginning (I'm not usually that good), even if I didn't know who was the culprit. But to me, that wasn't a spoiling of the enjoyment of reading the story, cause there were many points I deeply appreciated, two out of them, the love story and the setting.

The setting was faboulos, and considering I love that Gilded Age atmosphere, and I usually try to visit at least one of those villas each time I'm in the US, I was fascinated like Griff by the architecture, and I believe the description of the lives of who was lucky enough to grew up among those walls was spot on. And the there was Pierce, so handsome and aloof, but only at first glance, cause he is the one initiating the spark between Griff and him, and once fire took place, it's hot. The sex scenes, when happening, were at the same time erotic but classy, perfectly in character with the protagonists, and again, the setting.

I often say that, but I have to say it again, once you read a novel by Josh Lanyon you have the best of two worlds, the romance and the mystery/thriller.",1

"What would have happened if I got that letter when I was supposed to? Danny Collins (Pacino) is a rock star who peaked years ago. He is coasting through life playing concerts when he can and playing the same songs over and over. When he is shown a letter that John Lennon wrote him many years before he rethinks his life and career. With a new look at life he heads to New Jersey to find the son he never knew and start writing again. As many of you know by now I am a huge Pacino fan. I think he is the greatest actor working today but some of his recent movies I haven't been a big fan of. He was great in The Humbling but I thought the movie was a little slow. This is a role that seemed like a stretch for him (he does his own singing) but because he is so great he pulls it off and it seems like a role he was made for. The movie is very fun and easy to watch. The cast is great and the writing is funny and heartfelt. Only an actor like Pacino can turn a clichd cheesy line like some dinners are worth fighting for into something that is meaningful. Overall, I am a little biased because Pacino is my favorite actor but this is a great movie and his best movie in a few years. I give it an A.",1

"I enjoyed it very much. It was fast paced and exciting. I also liked how Riddle (pen name?) tied in the Spanish flu--with its mysterious cytokene storm. I have to admit I don't quite understand how the ""bell"" disease vector worked exactly.

Coincidentally? Stephen King's--The Stand--worked in an almost identical fashion with the first exposed dying within minutes and those secondarily exposed later taking a couple of days and then several days to die, while those who were immune were just immune.

I realize that no novel can tell everything, but there are a crucial two months missing, where a plague apparently swept the Earth and the ""Immari Imperium"" began. Finally, and for me the most vexing thing, is the fact that there are aliens beneath the Antarctic and we don't know a thing about them except that they built a device that transmits a virulent plague.

"I just love this bracelet.

It came in a nice blue box, like others have said, the stickers do not remove easily for re-use, but you could always put your own sticker over it if you wanted to re-use the box.

Inside the box was a black suede drawstring pouch sitting atop the foamy padding in generally find in jewelry packing.

As for the bracelet itself, it's beautiful.  My 18 yr daughter loves it, so I imagine I'll be sharing.

It feels rather luxurious to be wearing all of these pearls, which are intertwined with a dark brown string and crystals.  The crystals have a great sparkle to them which adds an element of bling to the pearls.  The pearls are large in size, and definitely potato shaped.

The pearls do have markings on them which do appear to be from tools, many of the pearls are unmarked though and I don't feel like it distracts from the beauty.

As for the brown cord, it clearly shows the brown cord in the photos, so it's to be expected and I don't mind it one bit.

The size of the bracelet is a bit on the small size.  I am smaller boned and don't have tiny wrists, but they are probably smaller than average and I feel most comfortable using the extender when clasping the bracelet together.

All in all, this is a bracelet that I will wear a lot.  With the coloring you can easily wear it with jeans just as well as with a more glamorous outfit for a night out.",1

"***UPDATE: December 10th, 2016 - Now that the price dropped to $260, plus $20 rebate, I take back everything I said about the RX 480. Because now, you're essentially paying the same price, for up to 50% more power. The compromise is the increased power draw and electricity bill, but if you're a PC gamer, you don't really care about it too much. Performance is the ultimate goal, and this card delivers in spades. It is the perfect balance of price/performance - $150 cheaper than a GTX 1070, for about 80-90% of the performance. That's amazing.

This is amazing deal, compared to what the other R9 Fury's that are selling on Amazon. It's a little too little, a little too late, as the RX 480's and the the GTX 1060's are already here, with a better price per performance ratio. In a sandbox, an R9 Fury for $350 is a great deal, so that's why I'm giving it give stars. But in the real world, you would be better off to get two Rx 480 4GB's, and only pay $50 more for about 1.5x the performance.

"I do not like to retell the whole story of books,as it already has happpened in other reviews. That said, this book was tense, very real, and kept me reading at all hours.

"This is a delicious novel. I haven't laughed out loud so much at a book since reading Janet Evanovitch. If a zany plot and quirky characters (to say nothing of an appealing dog who steals cling film wrapped human fingers from the 'fridge - don't ask, read for yourself) are your sort of thing, then you should definitely buy this.

"The whole movie is promoting BUDWEISER beer. Is it a lie that Budweiser is the only beer available?

The human nature attracts to beautiful woman and strong handsome man. That is the truth. In the wild male bird gets attention from the mate, becuase their feather is shining and their voice is loud. Why Jennifer Garner should marry a fat and no-that-good-looking guy instead of Robe Lowe?

You do not have tell a lie when you do not have to say something. In the movie it considers you have to say what you are thinking. It is not real.

What people say is not always sure it is true or ""not true"". For example, if I say I am going to meet you at 9AM, and I show up at 9:05. Is it a lie?

I do not have religion. But I have no way of proofing there is no God. In the movie it mentions about mansions afterlife. How about 60"" 3D hi-definition TV for everybody, etc.? It's not what religion about.",1

"After finishing The Cypress Project, I was eager for more, so I grabbed the other two novellas for the series. I wish I had I known, before buying the Kindle version, that this one was available for free online, because it was not nearly as long or satisfying as the previous novella. The cover is absolutely stunning, yes, and the content is interesting. Its just that it was over before I knew it, which was really disappointing. The glimpse of a new secret on Arras was definitely cool (and came in handy when reading the next book), but it was just way too short. Why did I rate it the same as The Cypress Project then? Well, I liked the content  I just wanted MORE! Seriously, save your money and just read this one online.",1

"Rosemary Sutcliff is expert at what she calls the ""hidden"" history of the art world. The story centers on the early days of the art world, when the first art galleries were established. When art galleries were established in the 1920s, the most famous artists were artists who knew little about the art world. As they grew older, the art world became more and more entangled with art galleries, galleries, and galleries. The Art Gallery of London, for instance, was the first art gallery in England, and it was in the United States that the first art galleries were established.

"I just got this cage today. I'm so glad I did. I have two parakeets so the size is a bit of overkill but they will have plenty of room in there. They aren't ready to free fly around the room yet.

I was a little leery of the cage because of the reviews that it's difficult to put together. The pieces are not labeled but if you take time in the beginning to figure what goes where based on the pictures it actually goes together pretty easily. It takes a hex wrench, which it comes with, so no extra tools are needed. I was able to put it together by myself in about 45 minutes.

It's bigger than I expected it to be, but it will be worth it for happy birds.",1
"The best comparison I can think of is one of the Gladwell books. The book takes a very different view upon how organizations should view themselves. I think it is a great perspective and is quite a fun read.

While it is highly repetitive (""People do not buy WHAT you do, they buy HOW you do it"" is said at least a dozen times), the actual message is really interesting and something I should apply to my life every day (aka Gladwell).

A lot of the examples are quite interesting and this is certainly worth the price. As a recent college hire that works as an analyst, I now try to approach all of my analysis asking myself ""why am I doing this?"" and ""how can I accomplish it?""",1

I find it to be a wonderful camera for what I needed:  A camera that had fast, crisp autofocus and could take shots at a speed faster than every 3 or 4 seconds (which seems to be the typical recovery/ready time for most point and shoots in my experience).  Plus, I am rediscovering the joy of artistic photography with this camera.  I'll let the professionals argue over the value and performance for them, but for me, this is a winner!",1

It always amazes me how K'NEX pieces can form different buildings and pieces, but they do it and it works.  Like I said, my kids don't watch Family Guy, but they loved this little Time Machine and the Stewie figure.  They think its cool to have built a time machine, even if it is just pretend.  I will say this set does not hold together too well to play with, we had issues with the door coming off, but maybe that was just our building issues.

"ok ever since this whole walking dead phenomenon started my hubby has been on this survival gear kick for ""just in case"". I usually laugh at it, but it got me thinking, I have been in situations living around the world where I was stuck in the worlds worse typhoons and was without for a long time. It would have been nice to have some of this survival gear. And that made me think I do live in a area where natural disasters happen, you never know and you do want to be prepared. So when I came across these emergency thermal blankets, I thought perfect, it will go great in my emergency kits for the cars and the house. It comes in a pack of 10, which is so nice, because I have them in my emergency kit in the cars and the house. Each blanket comes individually wrapped in it's own ziploc type bag for easy storage. The bag is about 4 3/4"" x 3"" in size. Fully opened, the blanket measure approximately 81 1/4"" long x 51 1/2"" wide. These blankets are said to reserve/reflect about 90% of your body heat. They are also waterproof and weather proof. Hopefully I will never have to use them in an emergency, but it puts my mind at ease knowing I have them and that they work really well!!

"I'm not a big DC comics fan, I find many of their heroes and villains to be rather unimaginative, there are simply better choice out there. My son in law really wanted to see this, so I rented it, and was pleasantly surprised. There were a few hokey bits (Batman doesn't kill Superman because their mothers had the same name?) but overall it was enjoyable, had a decent plot, and good action scenes. This is high praise from one who couldn't watch all of the last Superman movie. DC may do better in their ensemble pieces, like Suicide Squad or the Justice League. The teasers for the JLA looked pretty good, and Gal Gadot made a kick ass Wonder Woman, who enjoyed the fight.

I ended out buying a much better blade and it hasn't chipped a single one yet. I guess I should know you get what you pay for.,1

If you're a Gibson fan, this movie is worth the price of admission.A very good movie. I love the fact that it is a comedy. I will watch it again.Good movie.  But not great.  I think the acting is better than it should be.  You have to have a really good story line to enjoy it.  There is a scene where a woman is trying to get a divorce from her ex-husband.

This particular unit has a 7 gallon capacity, a glass-lined tank, and a recovery rate of almost 7 gallons per hour.

In my review video I cover the main features and issues with this water heater, but briefly:

This 7-gallon heater is large! The dimensions are 17.5 W x 17.5 H x 14.5 D. This was too large to install in our bathrooms or kitchen, so we had to install this in our basement crawlspace.

Also keep in mind that the unit itself weighs about 30 pounds, and with the extra weight of 7 gallons of water, the total weight of the heater will be almost 90 pounds. We set the heater on cement blocks to make a firm foundation.

Hooking up the plumbing to the unit is relatively straightforward, though in our case, because we installed the unit in our basement, we had to tap into the hot water run.  But this location would also not cause any house damage if the unit leaked.

Hooking up the electricity was more difficult, since we had to hire an electrician to make a hard-wired 12A and 120V connection the heater needs.

We are happy with this unit. The time it takes to get hot water is much shorter than it used to be, and seven gallons is enough of a reserve that we don't deplete it before our main hot water heater kicks in.

So all in all we have been very happy with this Bosch water heater, though again keep in mind the size and weight limitations of the 7-gallon unit.

I hope this review has been helpful!",1

"My cat was eating Purina Indoor Cat Chow. He was throwing up 1-5 times a day. He had already gone to the vet and they found nothing wrong with him, so before taking him back I thought I'd try switching his food. I bought him Purina Cat Chow Gentle and Purina One Sensitive Systems and this food won. He hasn't thrown up once since he started eating it in the last week. He used to eat a very expensive cat food and he threw that up too (though not as often). I was able to cancel his vet appointment for now and save another $200+ vet bill. I'm glad amazon had it because my local stores only carry at 3. 5lb bag for $8. I have 3 cats to feed so I need large bags. They will eat what he eats.",1

"Loved it!!!

Chantal Fernando's incredible writing combined action packed scenes and a healthy dose of freaking HOT characters and their kick ass love interests has become a knockout favourite of myself and many, and I for one cannot wait for Vinnie's story (Wolf's Mate) out in August.

Talon is an interesting character that has all the bad assery of an MC President of the Wild Men MC with the sweetness of a Wind Dragon MC Hottie. I liked that he wasn't the biggest manwhore of the bunch. I loved watching him get through his feelings for Tia.

Tia is freaking hilarious, she says it like it is no lies no games. Being a single mum she has her fair share of problems and having Talon come in when life gets harder is a bonus plus for her.

As a couple they rock the pages and bring about a different flavour to the series as a whole. Alliances will have to be upheld for this couple to flourish.

The sexy scenes are sweet and spicy.

Overall I LOVED IT!!!!!! and I cannot WAIT for Wolf's Mate!!!! Mine is already pre-ordered and awaiting publication!!!! This series gets better and better with each instalment and I love how there is an opening for more Wind Dragon MC and Wild Men MC Hotties to get their HEA's. I also love how all the past characters (YES I MEAN YOU SIN!!!! Sigh I love him) interact with all future story's.",1

"Dracula
too long & too slow

Keanu Reeves was probably the weakest link.  His British accent has been described as too posh.  His acting is wooden & unconvincing.

The costumes and makeup are amazing

Frankenstein

Just did not work -- the beginning, middle, and end do not come together

While Branagh gets to show off his athletic torso that is not enough to save the film.

Something between Branagh & Helena Bonham Carter doesn't work.  They have no chemistry together?

There are so many things in this film that do not make sense.  For example, Frankenstein cuts off a head to use for the monster & uses a different brain.  So why is the monster's face a patch work of stitches?  Apparently, there was no reason why Frankenstein would use a different lip or cheek or eye, but the stitching was supposedly scarier.",1

"If your desire is to use an electric drill, you may need to make a small hole in the bottom of the drill to get a solid surface to hold the drill in place. This is common in small drill bits.

I used a drill press with an adapter and a lot of pressure to hold the drill in place. I did not use the standard drill press so I could not test the impact.

-My cat is a big chewer and I thought this was a cute toy to hold in her mouth. She just pulls it out of her mouth and then shakes it around so the clasp slides down into her mouth. I feel like the clasp is too tight because she is very far away from it. I wish they had made this one a little bigger. I would have given it a 5. The clasp is very sturdy. The clasp is very comfortable. The clasp does not slip out of the clasp, so it is secure and secure. The clasp is very easy to put on and remove.

"This is an evaluation, in part,  of the negative aspects that all religions are capable of, and indeed prone to committing towards humanity.  The historical records of Christianity, Judaism and Islam are not as unblemished as their proponents would  have us believe..
The author directs his rhetoric towards a Christian individual, seemingly because, as he points out, Christianity has been unquestionably responsible for more bloodshed throughout the ages than any other  religion.  The author points out that morality is quite possible without the fear of God, and to a great  extent, nations  fare better with a lesser involvement
in religious matters..  Statics show  relations between degree of religious adherence and crime, infant mortality, educational performance of its children and several other indices.  The skeptics come out on top in all sociological matters..Doesn't it seem outlandish that in order to run for a political office in the United States, one must profess a deep religious sentiment,.. ..truthful or not?  A person of sterling qualities, honest, caring for his fellow human being, moral in every way, does not stand a chance if he would claim to be an atheist. Something is terribly wrong with this. We could take a lesson from Western Europe, where religious practice is at a bare minimum,, but their kids do better in school than our kids do, they live longer than we do, and more newborns make it to adulthood than ours do.
This book must be read in a calm and sober way.  The author is not attacking the religious individual;  just questioning the true validity of all these man made concepts and gods.",1
"Decent right angle clamp built with aluminum jaws, and steel threads.  Plenty of clearance for getting the joint spot welded, and the center clamping piece 'floats' so it will hold pieces of different thicknesses at a precise right angle.
In fact, the aluminum seems to be powder coated smoothly enough to be able to hold pieces together for things like wooden picture frames, without marring them, at least until you use them as welding clamps and get weld spatter on them.  There is even enough clearance for a nail gun, to tack the pieces together, if you would want.
Precisely made, I consider these to kind of fudge the line between light duty and medium duty as far as welding clamps go.  I checked the angle with a machinist's square, and it was right on.  Great for small or precision projects.  I would even consider them for woodworking projects, where a right angle clamp would be needed.",1

Rose Harbor in Bloom (Rose Harbor #2).
The Inn at Rose Harbor (Rose Harbor #1).

A great addition to Debbie Macomber's easy reading novels about family and friendships in a small town.
This new addition is a spin-off of sorts from her hugely popular Cedar Cove series which is now televised on Hallmark Channel. The characters at Rose Harbor are as friendly and hospitable as their neighbors in Cedar Cove. The setting revolves around a newly widowed woman who pours all her energy into the Inn which she was supposed to run with her husband. The interesting characters who come by for a visit are sure to delight.

In the second book, Jo Marie continues putting the final touches on the Inn with help from a handyman who doesn't like to talk about himself much. Although she finds him incorrigible at times, they seem to enjoy each other's company. A friendship appears to be in bloom at Rose Harbor Inn.",1

So we have been drinking wine for the last two months and it's still beautiful! We just ordered a pair of the best bottles of wine and they are exactly the same. I love that we can order one of these at a time for one wine purchase and see the difference in the quality of the wine. We are very happy with our purchase and would definitely recommend this wine brand!This is a fantastic product. I am very pleased with it. I have been using it for a month now and the color is wonderful. It is very well made and the color is beautiful. It is definitely worth the money. I would highly recommend it. This is a great product. I have to say it is not the most durable liner I've ever used. It's a little hard to pull off the metal rod because the plastic doesn't stay flat on the floor. I have had it for a couple of months now and it is still working great. I just wish it had a stronger tip. I'll update this review if I find a better one. One thing to be aware of is that the base is plastic. It will not be strong enough to hold a wine bottle on. That's why I decided to buy it. The lid is solid and well made. It holds wine well. It does not leak. It does not bend. It is great for storing wine bottles and bottles. I would recommend this liner. I think it is very well made. I would recommend this liner.

"From the female of the family: This beautiful top is a lot more than a ""T-shirt."" It is simple, yet elegant. It's reversible -- no, you don't wear it inside out -- but can wear front or back as the front! This means, the neck is either ""boat"" or a shallow V.

I like the sleek design and my favorite thing is the rich blue color.

One negative is that the large size fits me, but I wear a 36 C bra, and this top accentuates my bust more than I like. I know, I know -- a lot of women like a top that clings, so I haven't taken off any stars for that -- it's personal preference.

"I was reluctant to try this process, feeling a bit snobby as a mid-career artist with a BFA and MFA in painting. I was leery of sappiness of this program. But finding myself frustrated with my work, feeling too tightly wound and over analytical, it was just the anecdote I needed. In some ways this program is the counterbalance to my MFA program which I finished 15 yrs ago and left me firmly planted in my brain - thinking, thinking, thinking - over thinking. This book helped me to create again through my intuition and to trust my instincts. I'm certainly not suggesting that thought and analysis are not important integral parts of art making which is at its core problem solving. But I do agree with the premise that artistic ""block"" stems from living too much in your brain.

The book gives you simple weekly and daily exercises that are reflective and thoughtful. There is plenty of talk of ""god"" or ""spirit"" ""source"" or ""universe"" but it also clarifies that you may simply substitute in ""creative intuition"" or ""muse"" or some such term if you are not comfortable with the religious undertones. For me this was uncomfortable at first, given that I was totally in my rational head, but this sort of leap of faith is just what I needed. Some of the exercises did not apply as well to me, but I can almost always find some benefit, even if small. Many are cathartic. The daily process of the morning pages is both a grueling task and a revelation.

In conclusion, I would highly recommend this process for any creative person, no matter what ""level"" you have achieved thus far. There is always room to grow and learn, and this is a provocative and enriching experience.",1

"I usually wear a 7 or 7 1/2 in most sandals, but I ordered an 8 due to reading the reviews.  I am so glad that I did.  They fit just fine. After one day, I got an abrasion to the top of my foot from the sandals.  I am not sure if it was because of the amount of walking I did, or were they shoes too closely fitted?  I have only worn them once, and I walked for quite a bit on the first day.  They were very comfortable and the nice lining helps your feet to not sweat.  So far so good, with exception of a small cut on top of each of my feet.  Hopefully it is just having to break the shoes in one day.

August 2014...Months later... these must be the worst Born sandals purchase ever.  Every pair I have purchased have been worn and worn.  However, the top strap of the shoe digs into the top of your foot.  I even had my daughter try them since she has smaller feet than me, and the top rubs slightly against the top of your feet when walking.

If you do not do a lot of walking, these shoes may be for you.  However, the top strap will rub gently, at first, into the top of your foot.  After a few hours, that gently part will start to form redness on your feet.  I never had Born shoes that did that to my feet before.  Maybe I just got a bad pair because it is mostly just the left shoe.",1
"This book is a wonderful read with a storyline that is unlike anything else I've read. In today's world where technology is quickly replacing human jobs and functions, it is interesting to read a book about a world that needs a human for something that robots and technology can't do. You'll find yourself caught up in this book very quickly and you won't be able to put it down as you follow the story of Charles Dunn as he works to save the entire human population.  I would definitely recommend this book and I am looking forward to reading more from Diana Metz in the future.",1

"This movie is visually stunning, no doubt. The plot is one thrill after another. Sandra Bullock owned the role of Ryan Stone. She and George Clooney were fantastic. However, the plot holes and unscientific twists nagged at my enjoyment. Is it really that easy to hop from one station to another? And  spoiler alert  why in the world would George Clooneys character be compelled to let go???? No force, such as gravity, was acting upon him. All Sandra Bullocks character had to do was tug him to her and he would float back in her direction. Geesh. I just really didn't want his character to die.",1

"This excellent novel explores the tensions between the sexes in the 1800s. Though no one who reads Atwood should be surprised by her orderly, logical, deeply considered characterization, Grace Marks is a new high in Atwood's repetoire. Atwood's word play also flits around the book, and riffs on certain terms reflect and reverberate with studied meaning. I won't spoil it any more for you. It's an excellent book.

Comes with a carrying bag, I laughed when I thought of taking it apart. However I did because I returned it. Here's the real honest truth, cheap ,flimsy and over priced. The smaller tower was less frustrating to assemble, in the photos it shows areas where the inside poles Velcro to the tower. No, there are ties and do not stay in place. The tower that's supposed to attach to the other part with a loop and button thing, does not stay connected or flush together. My poor daughter was so upset since she was getting stuck between the 2.

I always thought the top was going to blow off at any minute!  That fear kept me from pressure cooking for a very long time. I happened to see a Youtube video of someone cooking in one of these and they explained that they are safe because there are several layers of safety designed right into this that prevent the problems associated with the earlier stove-top pressure cookers.

You can't go to a junk food drive through and get back home any faster than you can cook delicious meals in this without leaving the house!

One more thing - the food that comes out of this has sooooooo much flavor!  Any spices you use are forced into the meat because its cooked under pressure.  Your meat is tender, flavorful and juicy.

"This is just like the V911 and V912 helos.  But bigger.  Significantly bigger.

Lots of purists hate this helicopter. They say its like driving a school bus. EXACTLY. If you're looking for a tiny agile helo to do cool tricks this isn't it. If you're looking for a big-boned helo that sounds awesome, that you can feel the wind from, that you can shred your trees and frighten your animals this is it. You can fly this thing very high and a long way away since you can still sight it due to its size.

Do not get this as your first helo. You need to know how to fly a V911 or V912 size first. This could seriously damage something (or someone) in your yard. Also, while this helo can take a reasonable beating, you'll damage it pretty quick if you don't know how to fly it. Heavier weight equals more damage.

"What a extreme disappointment this kayak is.  I ended getting a hole right in the seam of the haul right underneath where I was sitting. This occurred after my third time taking it out. I was a couple miles down river from my car and was left stranded with a sinking boat beyond repair. The repair kit would not hold at the seam and I had zero chance of making a safe return.

I emailed Sea Eagle about my issue and had sent them a picture of the hole to which they replied the hole would not be covered under the warranty and there was nothing they would do. So basically I'm left with a useless boat and I just threw it away.

Even though this craft maker claims there is a warranty be very careful you don't damage it because you may be stuck with a whole lot of uninflatable rubber like me.

Also, the foot pump busted after the first use and I just bought a hand pump to use. The boat itself would constantly pull and never tread in a staight line.

I thought about upgrading to the tougher 380x, but after further consideration of their warranty, or lack there of, I decided against spending that much on something that may leave me in the same predicament.",1

The back cover folds pinch in if you use the elastic strap to hold the cover closed, would have been five stars if that did not happen.",1

The game is very fast paced and very easy to play. My only complaint is that the game is kinda hard to beat. If you are looking for something that is just a simple game, this is it!  It's easy to learn and fun for everyone!  I would highly recommend this game. Perfect for my son's classroom. He loves to play with it and plays with it all the time.

I like Greek Mythology so this book was an interesting addition to my collection of Greek Mythology. I read it in a matter of days and then the next day I was done and now I have a collection of books to read. I enjoy reading about ancient Greek mythology and have read every book by this author. I also love the fact that it is a collection of Greek Mythology. This book is a must read for any Greek Mythologist. This is a great book for any age. It is the perfect book for any age. This is a great book for a beginner or intermediate level runner. It is easy to follow and has great photos to show how to run. The book was a good read for an advanced runner who is looking for a new way to run. This book is definitely for anyone who wants to get a deeper understanding of running and what it really is like to run. I recommend this book. My daughter loves this book.

"I'd tried flying helis years ago and didn't have a great experience. I was not interested in spending a majority of my time fixing things when I would have rather been out flying. This little guy flew great out of the box. I will say however that you need to make sure you check this heli out before flying it. I found a blade grip screw that needed a little tightening and one of the pitch rod links was out of its slot on the rotor head. As with any heli, it should always be checked out before its first flight and never assumed the manufacturer has done everything correctly out of the box.

The V977 is responsive and does what you ask of it. Sure its a little quirky. You constantly have to be mindful of the throttle and it doesn't take much wind to blow this guy around. Now granted I've only flown in 6G mode and I'm more of a beginner/intermediate pilot. This is a great heli for taking to the park and practicing hovering in all orientations, pirouettes, circles and figure eights. I can't speak for 3D as I don't know how to yet. The manual is of course written in Chinglish. I had to get most of the instructions from youtube vids. Just make sure your throttle hold is off, your idle up is off and throttle stick all the down before turning on the tx - the rest you can get from youtube.

Make note this is not a throw away heli after a couple of flights, otherwise known as an Airhog or something similar. You can actually buy spare parts for this guy. However, ironic as it is, the heli does take quite a beating. I highly recommend someone new to the RC Heli hobby start with this particular copter, or just stick to micro helis starting out. Get a lot of practice on a sim (FS One, Phoenix, Real Flight, Accu-Sim, X-Heli or whatever), and then take what you learned outdoors without having to worry about dumping an expensive first helicopter.",1

"I've had this for about 2 months now, and overall I like it.

The device itself works fine.  I think it may have been better for my particular picky cat if the waste was stored at the back, not by the entrance, but beyond that it rakes and stores and is super easy to change.

Where I'm less satisfied is the litter itself.  I've gone through a lot of it transitioning my cat over from his old stuff (on my 4th refill) but I can't imagine it lasting an entire month.  Beyond that, it gets everywhere.  It's a little sharp/uncomfortable when you step on it; and I'm starting to wonder if I just traded one type of work (cleaning the box) for another (cleaning all around the box...and into the other rooms it gets tracked).  I tried using the hood to contain it a little better but had to stop because my cat refused to go in that way- I'm not sure whether it was the smell, since the waste is stored by the entrance; or if it's also a little uncomfortable on his delicate paws.  But he's picky, even for a cat, so maybe that's a unique issue.

Bottom line: I can't fault the device, really, besides one little design adjustment I'd make.  The litter, however...I wish you could use alternatives.",1

"I heard the author in a workshop that he gave and it really whet my appetite to read the book and try out what he suggests.
I have read countless books on dating, trying to figure out what I have been doing  wrong, how/why I keeping picking/attracting the wrong partners, why there  has been so much resentment, conflict and bitterness in my past  relationships, etc.
After I read the book it all became crystal clear to  me.  I had been considering personality compatibility, but only in a  general way. Neither my partners nor I were ""bad"" people, we were  just the ""wrong"" people for each other.
Dr. Avila's book  enables you to ""type"" yourself, how to quickly size up others for  their ""type"" and my favorite features, WHERE to meet others of  your compatible type and HOW to attract and build relationships with them.  These techniques apply to BOTH opposite AND same sex friendships. Very  targeted, specific information, very rare in dating books.
I realize now  that by following the advice in other dating books, I was hanging out in  the wrong places to meet MY best type.
His theories sound rock solid both  from a psychological and common sense point of view.
I think that his  book settles once and for all the opposites attract, but do they stay  together debate.
Lastly, I commend Dr. Avila for going beyond the theory,  and putting the principles into practice by actually encouraging/helping  set up LoveType social groups. In fact, I am going to his book signing  tonight, to be followed by mingling and discussion of starting up a social  group in the Los Angeles area.  I'm REALLY looking forward to what might  come of it!

I spent many happy hours with Dalziel and Pascoe, Joe Sixsmith and numerous other characters. And I saved this last stand-alone novel for three years. It was so worth it. He is as usual brilliantly smart, witty, and desperately in love with English language.

"I purchased this backpack because I read that this was a way to drain more energy from my dog during our walks.  He is a hound mix and he pulls me all over the place when we are walking and I am by no means a small woman.  As of right now we are at the point of him carrying one water bottle on each side for added weight.  It took a bit for him to get used to wearing this so I didn't want to push him too fast.  I imagine that the most I will work him up to is two water bottles per side as I read that they should carry about 5-10% of their body weight.  I have been very pleased so far with the results, while he does still pull me, he gets tired much quicker which saves my shoulders from his yanking.  I am very impressed by how sturdy this is made.  It was easy to adjust to fit him well, he weighs around 65 lbs.  I anticipate this lasting for many years because I have not even noticed a bit of wear and tear in it yet.  I have had many compliments on how dapper he looks in this backpack and folks seem to love the idea that I am giving him a job to do.  Very pleased with my purchase.

"The Dell USB 3.0 Dual Display Universal Dock D1000 is sleek, compact, and works very well.  Having used past Dell USB docks, I can say this new model does not come with the compatibility issues of prior versions.  The ability to utilize dual displays, plus it's compactness make it a great option on your desk.

The D1000 doesn't come with an abundance of ports, but it's does the job.  If there were one flaw it might be the ports, but it's hard to fault it with the multiple video outputs, network, audio, and more than enough USB ports.  I tested this with two 24"" displays.  I used multiple computers, including a few different laptops and a Surface Pro 3.  This included Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10.  I had a great experience with all variations.

The dock itself is fairly compact and go on top of your desk or on a shelf or other alternative.

"By far the best MTB purchase I've made all year! Ever since i rode my buddy's Cannondale Jekyll with his Rockshox Reverb dropper post, I've always wanted one of my own. With most dropper posts running around $300+ i could not really afford/justify buying one, being that my bike was only around $900. I did tons of research, read lots of reviews, and ended up stumbling across this dropper.

So far i don't have a single complaint about this post. I've been riding it for about a month and a half now and It actuates very smoothly, quickly, and reliably. The only drawbacks to this post that i can see are the amount of travel it offers (100mm compared to many droppers with 125mm, i personally find 100mm to be plenty), the quality of the button (its not bad, the LEV just has a nicer, ODI compatable one), and the left/right saddle wiggle (which is 100% unnoticeable when riding).

I would suggest the KS eTen to ANYONE looking for a quality dropper post without breaking the bank.

"Thought it was time my daughter got a tea set.  She's at the pretend play stage, so she enjoys it.  This one is cute.  Looks a little plasticky for Melissa and Doug, but of all the options of the larger size tea sets, this seemed the best.  Odd as it is to say, I wish that Melissa and Doug made a less ""pink"" set, so that we could get more use out of it with our younger son, but he's happy with pink so this is fine.",1
I would recomended this DVD. It's a great family movie and you won't mind watching more than a few times.,1
"I said just what I needed, and I meant it. This book goes into a lot of detail, however I was particularly interested in the sections on plants that work well, gardening bed ideas, the tools, and reading about the disadvantages. I live in a small but tall building with plenty of room on the roof. The space is not shared, so my wife has always wanted to grow her own vegetables on the roof. She got the idea from an article about urban agriculture, and she always wanted to know more. After I read the book, it was clear that it is perfectly possible, without the disadvantage of the cost mentioned. In my opinion it is affordable, and this book really showed me how. If you are in a similar situation to me, I would recommend reading this to see just how viable raised garden beds are. Thanks.",1
Perfect. It gives just enough light and is light weigh but sturdy. I actually put this on the top of a tall secretary that sits in a dark corner of my living room and it really lights up the dark spot. I am very pleased.,1
"I was interested in this book because I thought it would be a nice introduction to the history of the Civil War.  The Civil War was a fascinating time and a sad day in American history.  I found the story of how the war ended to be very interesting.  The author also had a very good perspective on the history of the military.  It is a very interesting book.  I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in military history.I like this book. It's very easy to read and the characters are very well developed. I liked that the narrator was a little more realistic and more real.I was thoroughly disappointed with the ending.  It did not go as planned.  I was disappointed with the way the author chose to leave us with the ending.  It was a sad story, but I really hope that we get to see more of the characters.I really enjoyed the book.  I didn't get to know the characters well enough to really understand them.  They were all very well developed and were believable.  I liked the story line but I felt like it was very contrived.  The ending was a bit abrupt.  I don't think it was the best ending.  I also liked the way the book ended and the fact that it was written in the middle of the night.  I think the ending was a little contrived. ",0

I enjoyed this book and look forward to reading more from this author. This is a good story. The characters are well developed. The story is well written and the story is very well told. The ending is satisfying and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good story. I loved this book. It was very sweet, very emotional, and had a really nice ending. I was just so happy that I got to read it. I was a little disappointed with the ending, but I was happy that I got to see a happy ending. This is the first book I've read by this author and it's definitely the best I've read in a while. I received this book free in exchange for an honest review. I loved this book. It was a little predictable but not too much. I liked the idea of the sisters coming together and getting their stories to make it to the end.",0
"Excellent lamp. Beautiful, well shines, and has the quality of a good lamp.

The only downside is that it's very dimmable, which is not the case with this lamp. This is a very small light, and it's not very bright. This is why I ordered this lamp. It's a great lamp, and it will last me a very long time.

I will say that I have not tried it with my other two lamps. I have tried both of them, and they are both very dimmable. The only drawback is that they are not ""over"" the dimmers, but rather they are ""off"". I don't want to overheat them, but I don't want to overheat them. I can't think of",0

"I was always a fond of this film as a kid, part Island of Lost Souls, part sci-fi and part historical nonsense, Atlantis the Lost Continent is certainly entertaining and for those of us who remember it fondly, this DVD release will surely be a treat. The widescreen print looks very good and is in color. I mention this because when I was growing up in the 60's we had a black and white TV set and watching this DVD was the first time I saw this film in color!

Like other Warner releases there isn't any extras, but a trailer. The price is steep, but Warner does run specials, which can bring the price down between $12.00 and $14.00. If you want the film at a reasonable price, wait until they run a sale.",1
"I'm a picky reader, in that I don't feel like I need to make up my own mind.

I found myself rooting for the characters and I loved how they got together and got their happily ever after. I am looking forward to the next book in this series.I read this book in one sitting, and I absolutely loved it! I was so excited to read this story.

"So far so good. I have a wide assortment of CLP's for my firearms and I recently decided to purchase a Glock and a lot of people recommended this product for it. It seems to work great, cleans it fine and like any other CLP it works pretty well as a lube. I still use solvents to clean the bore and barrel but the amount of carbon this stuff pulls off everything else makes it seem like it works well as a solvent as well. This is a very popular CLP overseas and has been around for a long time but I had never seen it in the local stores here so I am glad I picked it up.",1
"Sub Sports has my outdoor-compression-layer business for life!

I have arctic compression leggings from other big-names, and these blow them out of the water!  The fit is perfect, compression is even and full-length.  They feel like second skin, breathe well, wick moisture well, yet retain heat like a wool blanket.  These are better than Mil-spec ECW poly-pro, even with a base-layer added!  They also don't have a strong rubber smell, nor do they retain odors like some of the other brands do.

They do tend to ride a bit high on the waist if you opt for a larger than necessary size (looser fit), so be aware of sizing before purchasing.

I used the size charts on the Sub Sports website, and got a perfect fit.  If you are an athletic-build, or even average, then follow their sizing and you can't go wrong.  If you are muscular-bulky or have a few extra pounds, go up a size for a better or looser fit.

I also got the zip-top to match, and following the size chart would have put me in a large, but my son has this in a large (which is too short/tight in the sleeves for me), so I opted for the XL for better fit in my shoulder/arm length (I have broad sholders and 34-35"" sleeves), and the compression is still nice and snug top-to-bottom.

A word of warning... do NOT DRY THESE IN THE DRYER, or you'll never fit a toe back into them (or they will rip apart)... they must be line-dried or hung from a hanger.  They dry quickly so don't think it will take all day.

I wore a pair of these leggings kayaking last spring, and even though water was constantly getting me wet, within a few minutes of getting out of the kayak, I felt dry at the skin, and was NOT cold the whole time.",1

"Wow, this book is amazing! Well written and technically pretty good. Bob ""the Nailer"" is not one of those annoyingly perfect good guys that don't really exist. He has his share of problems, which are explained  in the book but not dwelled on for long.
There are some pretty good  reviews here that sum up the story pretty well, so I'm going to skip that.  I will say that I normally read only sci-fi/fantasy and had long ago grown  weary of these type of books. But the way Hunter combines the convoluted  plot twists that Ludlum loves so much with the attention to detail that  Clancy is so known for and then adds his own ability to tell a story in an  interesting way really hooked me.
You just may find yourself shopping for  a Winchester mdl 70 or a Remington 700 (in .308, of course) before the end  of this one!

Hint: Remove the rain cover from the cart and store it in the bag rather than where the company hides it.
She wanted the red one, but I talked her into black and she is glad I did. The Red/Black combo tries to look stylish, but comes off too industrial in real life. The red bag by itself would be terrific, but not paired with the black rolling cart. Interior size is adequate as expected. Anything roomier would look like every other generic rolling case. This vertical bag stands out from the crowd, but remains professional. I thought the patent leather would be gaudy, but it's subdued by the patterns.  Be a good husband and purchase this.",1

I'm amazed that there are more books by the same author. I also have a hard time putting them down. The stories are both entertaining and the writing is so great.

I truly admired the author for the skillful and purposefully methodical steps ultimately leading up to the grand finale.

How do you begin a new live when your name is not your own and you end up wherever you end up, not necessarily a place of choice? So many times we ask ourselves why does a woman stay and this book really does explain why. I have so much empathy and compassion for women in this position.

"I LOVE these. The only reason it isn't five stars is because it is a little smaller than I anticipated.

Unlike some other reusable bags I have, you don't have to fold this a certain way to get it back together. You just wad it up to stuff it back into the flower pocket and pull it tight and it looks as good as when it arrived!

It comes with a small clip if you want to clip it to a backpack, purse, or you can just put them all on one hood by their string to keep them all together when not in use.

They are small and don't take up a lot of room. I always have one in my purse when I go to a festival just in case I decide to make some purchases. I like the different colors, and when you open it, it's just that plain color, but has one stem on it, keeping the rose theme.

It's a great price, so I love throwing one in with a gift etc. Everyone really seems to like them and think they are clever and useful.

As for size, like I said it is much smaller than anticipated. This is definitely not a good bag to take grocery shopping when you plan on trying to stuff as many things as possible into the bag. When I gave one to a friend, she said it was the perfect size for milk. I think getting a whole gallon in here might not be optimal, but it can definitely carry a half gallon easily...

"OK, so first of all, as a calendar: I was annoyed that the numbers were all out of order. This made things difficult to find. I was also annoyed that the pictures on the front seem to indicate what will be behind which door, but then they weren't accurate. Now, all that said, it was nice that each door had a compartment tray behind it, and that they doors had directions on the back of the paperboard for each one. Each bag was also labeled with its number, just in case things got misplaced.

Now, as a Megablok set: I have really enjoyed Mega Blok's interpretation of Star Trek and TMNT characters. This set is a bit below the standards set by those previous sets. You only get 158 pieces, which isn't a terribly good value compared to other sets. Many of the pieces here are uninspiring to say the least. A bush? A weapon holder? There are, at least, three main characters to be had, Shredder, Casey Jones, and a turtle who can be switched via headband between all four characters. But the figures themselves are a bit below the standards set by other iterations. The legs don't move as well, the hands pop out of the arms for some reason, and assembling them is rather difficult for a kid, and even for a grownup, due to the difficulty of popping ball joints into sockets.

For the money, I'd prefer to see twice as many character figures and a lot less filler. My son, turning five in a few weeks, did enjoy that he could put together the simpler items on his own. But overall I think this represents a poor value compared to the other superior Mega Bloks sets in the TMNT family, such as the Krang set or the jungle tank set. And compared to other Advent calendar sets, such as the Lego Star Wars one, this is a poor value as well, as that set has 100 more pieces and 9 minifigures compared to 3 here.",1

I consider myself more then just a novice when in comes to the ins and outs of installing hardware and software.  But this one has so far managed to elude me.  I have an Asus P6T v1 and needed the SATA III along with the RAID capability.  I might note that my MB has two onboard RAUD controllers one of which is in use.  After about 26hrs straight of messing around with this thing I am positive there is some setting that I can't find or change that allows me to have both the RAID card and the onboard RIAD running at the same time.  I was able to get the RAID card to install and even managed a RAID0 config with windows installed.  But for some reason I am no longer able to get back into that windows config.  So I am trying my hardest to see a point in keeping this harware.  Tech support at High Point seem to be unable to give me an answer as to what settings I should be shooting for in both of the BIOS for the MOBO and the card.  Bottom line is relly unless you have a ton of time and a load of asprin I wouldn't suggest going for this card...

The ravishing and majestic direction of this film by the filmmaker is a must for any sci-fi fan.  Great story and the acting by the actors is top notch.  I highly recommend it.

"Wonderful story but it is not an easy read.  I will admit that I was a bit nervous about reading this story.  The characters were very well developed, the story was interesting and it was well written.  I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series.This is a very sweet story",0
"A brooding, suspenseful, thinking man's life. The story is a good read.

The author has done a great job of describing the characters.  The characters are not predictable, and it is easy to see why.  The main character, a young woman with an excellent sense of humor, is a woman who is trying to save her mother and her baby from a gang of gangsters.  She has a secret and a plan, and she is trying to get",0

"I like how this little speaker has the volume controls. I also like how it's been powered by a pair of speakers. I am using it with a TRS-80 and it's been working well so far. I would recommend this product. I purchased this device for my sister to use as a remote control for her Sony A-100. I was so excited to get it. It works perfectly and seems to be an excellent product. I will buy more of these again. I bought this for a friend, but he does not like it. I put it in a bag with a backpack and it is still working fine. I would not recommend this to anyone.",0
"I guess at this point it is grind out as many Patterson books as possible as fast as you can to make a killing. Well I got this from the library, thank someone!! The killer (paid assassin  called the Ghost) is painted in such a way that you just have to forgive him. There is murder, murder, murder, but her they are all bad guys. The Ghost is at once smart and dumb... that he lives through the book is only due to the fact that he is fictional. I skimmed several chapters just to get to the ending, and believe me you could skim the entire book and not miss any literary gems. Very disappointing. Robert Parker, where are you? At least you never sold out.",1

"I began a blog a little bit ago, and it wasn't working the exact way that I wanted it to. In order get better at designing my site I needed to learn HTML. This book caught my eye because to learn everything in one day seemed like to good to be true. This book begins with the basics, helping you to understand why to use html. The next part of the book is about the different things that you can do. Some of the things it talks about is the best way to make lists, creating specific text type, formatting links, even adding images and tables. I might not have learned everything in one day, but this was definitely worth the read. It will be one that stays in my reference section.",1
"Wow, I discovered a treasure chest when I downloaded this book. Being a busy person, I can appreciate it when I can shave a few minutes a day from activities that need to be done on a repetitive basis. That includes meal preparation. Who doesn't want delicious meals that can be prepared under half an hour? In twenty minutes, you can be eating one of these fifty satiating meals.

So far my favorite has been the ""Authentic Philly Cheesesteak Sandwich"". But that is probably because there are so many choices here, that I haven't had the chance to try everything yet. Can't wait to go through the rest of the recipes.",1

"Having watched the original series as a teenager, I was not too sure what to expect from this reincarnation of an American icon.  All I have to say is that I was not prepared for the next two hours.

There were familiarity as well as twists and turns with several shocks tossed into this stew.  At times I said to myself how could they do that or why change the original storyline?

At the end as the credits began and that music which we all knew so well, I said to myself that was exciting.  It all made sense.

There were some very sad scenes.  There were many heroic moments in the face of  death.

The Enterprise was a marvel to behold.  You could see how over four hundred federation representatives could fit on this flagship.

The actors did a noble job of living up to the legends with some twists.  The love interest was, well, you have to see it for your self.

If you go see this with a lot of Star Trek lore tucked away in your brain, be prepared to be unnerved.  If you know little of the original series or films, then this should give you a good introduction to the mythology which has been a part of our culture for the last 43 years.

Was it perfect?  No, but it came close.",1

If you like this movie, buy it.I can't imagine what this movie would have been like if it had been released on DVD. I'm not sure if it would have had a great soundtrack or just a few crappy songs.  But if you like this movie, buy it.  It's a lot of fun.I thought this was going to be one of the best shows ever made.  The acting was superb, the direction was perfect, and the production values were top notch.  I highly recommend this to anyone who has never seen or heard of the show.  If you're a fan of the show, then this is the show for you.  And if you're not a fan of the show, then you will love this show.  I can't wait for the next season of this show.

They're very comfortable but wow do my feet sweat way too much in these.  I've had these type of slippers before and never had this problem.  For wearing an hour or so they are super comfortable but beyond that they literally get squishy inside from the sweat.  Sorry if that's TMI just being honest.,1
What an awesome read! Melanie Shawn masterly crafted this suspense-filled romance that I could not put down! This is the first book in this series I've read and I'm going back and reading the other four ASAP!,1
"--Initial Review--
We added this to our collection and thought it would be a nice addition to the other one. I had to get a replacement and then the game was stopped. This is a game that is fun to play and a good size for the price. If you have a child that likes to play with the game, then this is a great game to play with. Overall, I would not buy this game for any reason. It's very simple to play and very easy to learn. The game will last a while and you will not feel like a loser.",0
"This is really a cute little set, with lots of variety in colors, shapes, and colors. It's not the best toy, but it is fun and educational. The colors are nice, and the little things in the toy are fun. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys the little guys. My son loves this game.",0
"I can't believe how much the dogs loved this toy. It makes noise by almost any movement and doesn't have an on/off switch. There's a little slot where a plastic tab prevents the noise from happening, but it would be better with an actual switch.",1
This knife was bought out of an online seller and is listed at $29.95.  It is so cheap that it is a must have for the kitchen.  The handle is nice and sharp and it is a good value.

It is easy to clean and easy to clean.  I would highly recommend this knife.I really love these.  I put them in a refrigerator and it's a real breeze to put,0
"These are a bucket list of things you want to try out.  These are the only ones I can think of that are worth your money.  The only reason I'm giving these four stars is because they are really good quality shoes.  If you're looking for something that will hold up to a day or two of walking, these are the shoes you want to try.  They're comfortable and look great.  I am returning them.  I will buy another pair.I got this for my son who is about to age out of his first year of school.  He is a big fan of the Casio leather shoes, but he loves the extra length.  The reason I got this is because I don't like the ""gleaming"" effect of the leather.  I wish the sole of the shoe was a bit longer, but overall I like the extra length.  He does not have wide feet, and the fit is good.  I bought a half size up, and the other half of the size was perfect.  He is 5'7"" and 130 lbs, and the length is a bit long for him.  I would recommend ordering up a size, but the higher the length, the better.  He is quite pleased with the quality.I ordered these in a size small and they fit perfect.  I bought them because I wanted a legging and a sandal, so they are perfect.  They are a bit big and thin, so I may need to stretch them a bit, but I love them.  They are comfortable and look good.  I did not purchase a size larger than normal because",0

A beautifully written book about a much maligned character who I always knew was so much deeper than he first appears. The way Lindsay has woven the threads we have only glimpsed in the past is a tribute to her skill and heart. Her new heroine is more than a match for him and their relationship reminds me so much of Ridge and Sardelle in its depth. I fervently hope that she will continue to write about them in the future as I am loathe to have this world and these stories end.,1
Very entertaining dialogue. Good reading. Looking forward to reading more from this author. Very good. I read this book in the last few days and have enjoyed it.,0

"Not often does science provide a more complete picture of a planet than science provides a description of the human body.  This is the most important step in the process of the evolution of the human body.  It is in this book that the authors are going to delve into the evolution of the human body.  They will examine the nature of the human body and the evolution of the human mind.  They will discuss the nature of the human mind and the evolution of the human mind.

"These are high quality batteries.  I have some I'm still using since 2003.  They only run about 70% as long as a new one but still going.  Another review mentioned that it would be unwise to buy a battery for $45 when you can get a battery, charger, and drill for $130.

"I have had 3 pairs of this headset. I lost one, bought one for my wife, and bought myself a replacement. As a mono bluetooth it works great, although a bit on the heavy side. As a stereo bluetooth I love it. I love not having a wire connecting to my phone when I am working out. I don't know how many times I unplugged or ripped my phone out of my pocket when the wired headset cable got snagged on something. This is just so much more convenient. Some complain that the sound it not as good, but I find it more than adequate for working out. When you buy a stereo bluetooth you are not looking for concert sound as much as you are looking for the safety and convenience of not having connecting wires hanging out of your ears. My only complaint is the ear look is of very poor design. I have had to call Jabra several times to order replacements because the bendable wire section breaks from the hard plastic part that goes into the ear piece. It got to the point that Jabra would just send me 3 complimentary ear loops at no charge.",1

The zipper is a little loose but I don't find that to be an issue.  I also like the fact that the pocket is a little small so you can carry a small key, a small wallet, and a small wallet.  It's very comfortable.  I have had no problems with the zipper.  I'm very pleased with this purchase.

Overall, this is a great bag.  It fits my bike perfectly.  It's comfortable, and I like that it has a leather belt strap for my wrist. ",0
I love the color selection!  Could use a green one though.,1
"At first I thought this book was taking place along time ago, because being from the USA, it's hard to think women are not even close to being equals with men,  in many parts of the world. It was shocking when the story was talking about planes and phones, that I got a wake up call this was a romance story for now. I personally thought  Hajar's reaction to his trauma was right on. People had a hard time looking at him, so of course, he would feel like the beast. I also liked the spunk of Katherine. My heart ached for her, on the reaction of her father, just because she was a women. I truly can't believe this book is free, I liked it that much. There is love making, but not the erotica type. The romance builds, which I also liked, they just don't fall head over heels for each other and have sex right away.",1

"Apple is more expensive than this. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the one-year warranty was very good. The case is clear, and the cover is very sturdy. I have had no issues with the cover, and it's protected with a good-looking protective sticker. The only complaint I have is that it's very hard to turn it off when you're driving, and if you pull it on, it won't turn on. It's very easy to turn it on, and it works well. The only issue I have is that the ""over"" button doesn't work, but it is there, and it's easy to press it. I did have to use the ""wishlist"" button, but it's not a big deal. I will be replacing this case with a different brand, as the case is more expensive. I'd definitely recommend this case to anyone who needs a case that will protect their car.Best portable speaker for the price.  The sound is good.  The only complaint I have is that the audio is lacking in clarity.  I was unable to get it to work with my Windows 10 PC.  I'll update my review after I get a chance.

"Elsa Quinn has been bullied her whole life, not just the kids at school but her mothers constant harping on weight loss has finally reached a boiling point.  Deciding to take matters into her own hands, Elsa joins a gym preparing to exercise the weight off.

Noah Stewart drives to another town to workout, as a football jock at school he gets inundated with his friends wanting to hang out while at the gym and he just wants to focus on working out.  When he sees Elsa, he wants to know why she is there, sure he has seen her at school but he wonders if she will tell people he is here.  Elsa though surprises him and realizing she has no plan, he offers to help her out.  At first Elsa questions Noah's intentions but realizes he has never been part of the bullying she accepts.  Noah doesn't plan on falling for Elsa though and he does, Elsa though is afraid of what going public will do.

I liked this a lot.  Noah's view on why Elsa is trying to lose weight is not what you would think.  Elsa is vulnerable, her mother is a class act and I can understand Elsa's choices.  Great read.",1

"Usually i get on an author about not being descriptive enough, this is one of the few that i wish he'd shut up. Here's a quick example.

""There was a flurry of movement in the shadows and the boy darted out quick as a thought. He took three paces at a dead run and stopped, stretched out his arms and breathed deeply of the wonderful air, his chest puffing out like a sparrow's, and he grinned a grin that spread from ear to ear. He stood there with his breath held letting the sun, that ancient and inexorable skygod, still only just begun his day's journey smile its primordial light upon him, warming him.""

That's not even the whole paragraph, but that only three sentences, THREE! I got 4% into this book before i couldn't take anymore. The author seems to feel the need to explain or describe EVERYTHING with excruciating detail.

Some may enjoy this brand of writing, but if the rest of the book is anything like this (no reason to think its not going by other reviews) then i am all too happy that stopped. I gave it 2 stars even though i couldn't bring myself to finish it because, again, some may like it and i'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt.

"This play house rates a lot of the pieces, and I'm not sure how well this one is going to hold up to the most typical toddler play.

This is a pretty nice set, and it's a good value for the price. My daughter is still very interested in the dinosaurs, but she's also starting to get interested in the toys on display at her new school. I'm hoping she'll be able to play with it for some time.

Overall, this is a very nice set, and I think it's a good value for the price.

Overall, it's a nice set, and I think it's a good value for the price.

I would definitely recommend this to any 3 year old or older.Very cute!This is a great starter set for little ones.  I used it for our toddler's ""workout"" on a rolling track.  It works great!  It is easy to put together, but not too hard.  My son had trouble getting it to rotate with the gears, so I would",0
"Works like a wonder. Super long and just amazing. I thought it would be super water repellent which has been what happens when I get towels like this but it seems to soak it in and then its gone. Not to mention it is soft and smooth. Though it does make it a bit slippery with socks on it is perfect with no socks on and it even allows me to stretch using the towel because it is so long. Especially when I forget to bring my bands. Would love more of them in different colors or patterns but this is close to tops in my book.

"Despite the errors in editing and there were not many of them, the story was great.  I got into it quickly and it was hard to put down.  I had it figured it who was the stalker to both Victoria and to Jack, with a little twist I didn't see coming.  The characters were believable and you could easily see where future books are headed.

Victoria is a fiesty woman who knows what she wants and goes after it.  Duke and Jack are perfect for Victoria and they make a great threesome.  I loved the scene in the bar where all 7 women were getting toasted and giving to tips on what to do with Duke once they got home.  Fortunately Duke was there to be there designated driver.

I love HEA's  and this one had it in spades.  You can read them as they come out, but if you've never read this series before, start at the beginning so you know who all the characters and how they came to be a threesome.",1

"While the first Dark Screams volume was a wild mixture of stories without a recognizable common theme, this second collection seems better tuned. It presents stories of dark things lurking in completely unobtrusive places. A swimming pool, walls in a house, or even a wardrobe - suddenly they reveal a hidden evil which bereaves them of their inconspiciousness.

The Deep End (Robert McCammon)
Very straightforward and uncomplicated. My only criticism would be the unnecessary 'epilogue'. I guess this one is my favorite. 4 stars.

Interval (Norman Prentiss)
The first part really gave me the creeps because of its realistic subject. Unfortunately, the author added some supernatural element which didn't work out for me, but add confusion to an otherwise great story. 3 stars

If These Walls Could Talk (Shawntelle Madison)
Nice one with an unexpected twist that caught me by surprise and made me shudder. I loved the detail with the fox eye. 4 stars

The Night Hider (Graham Masterton)
Great reference to the author C.S. Lewis, though I would have preferred something more fantastic in the line of his work. The ending was not as climactic as expected and Jerry's sacrifice seemed unnecessary. 4 stars

Whatever (Richard Matheson)
A collection of song lyrics, interview snippets and articles, loosely connected into a story about a rockband. Dragged on and on without getting anywhere. Sorry, this was not my cup of tea. 1 star

A nice collection with some great authors, perfect to pass some time.

You get the box and go. The pieces are just too small. There is a tiny piece of cardboard that you can push the pieces out and then put them back in. I used this to make a little cake. The pieces are very small. My daughter is still very young and still gets a kick out of it. The kids love the kids. There is a great variety of colors and shapes to make it fun for them. It's easy to play and fun for everyone. I bought this for my son for Christmas. He loved it and it was great!  He is 6 years old and loves this.,0
"I have a 15-pound red kettlebell from GoFit.  At the time I am writing this review, you don't seem to be able to select that combination of options on Amazon, but that may change in the future as things come into and/or go out of stock.  And much of what I say will apply to any of the GoFit kettlebells that are currently being offered.

At any rate, I am very happy with this kettlebell.  It is comfortable to hold and I like the vinyl coating (not on the handle, just on the colored part as seen in the product images).  I have had my kettlebell for at least 5 or 6 years and have used it periodically and the coating does not seem to degrade.  It basically still looks the same as the day I got it.  I have not had any problems with this kettlebell slipping in my hands, either.

15 pounds is a little bit of a challenge for me and I can't use this kettlebell for every kettlebell exercise that I do.  I also have a smaller one for some exercises, and switch out as needed.  If you are planning to get into kettlebell training at a serious level, you will probably want to have a few kettlebells of different weights.  I find that a kettlebell workout works the legs more than you might expect (you don't notice it at the time but you feel it the next day).  For reference, if it helps in terms of selecting a kettlebell weight for you, I'm a small-framed woman in my mid-30s and I'd consider myself intermediate/advanced when it comes to most home exercise programs.

The DVD that came with this was not really a complete workout.  However, I thought the instructor (Sarah Lurie) was good and it motivated me to buy a couple of her full-length workout DVDs (many are available here on Amazon).",1

"To begin with, my grandsons, ages 4 and 6, had already been watching the show and really liked it, so they were more than delighted to get their own Chuggington to play with. The thing I like about this toy is its sturdiness.  If it's one thing I've learned about little boys it's that they are rough on toys, yet they get upset if something breaks.  I sympathize with the person who said the cars fall off the tracks, but my experience has been that unless you pay a lot of money and buy replicas of real trains and anchor the tracks down permanently somewhere, you will have that problem with any toy that runs on tracks.  Also, the set is chunky enough and easy enough to set up to not frustrate small children whose fine motor skills are not that well developed.  Therefore, the toy helps give children confidence that they can do something themselves.  And I think that any toy that lets children use their own imagination when they play is very good.  There are far too many toys out there that don't do that.  Everything is already imagined for the child.  Not only are these toys not helping children, they are downright boring to play with.  I don't believe that most people realize how important it is for children to develop their imaginations.  This is not something frivilous.  It is those who can imaginine new technology, new inventions, and new and better ways of living that bring progress to the world.",1
My 2 year old got this for his birthday and it was a hit! He loves it and we have two small cars and the track is perfect for him to drive around. I would definitely recommend this toy to any kid. I would recommend it for any kid who loves cars and trucks. I bought this as a gift for my grandson. He's 4 months old and has already started playing with it. I highly recommend it for any age. It's very easy to put together and is very durable. The only thing I would say is that it does break easily. I've found that it is really difficult to get it together. We bought a wooden dowel and it broke easily. The pieces are made of thin plastic. I've had no problems with this being broken. My grandson is almost 3 and loves to play with it. It's very well made and really fun. I would recommend this to anyone. My son loves this set and the only thing I don't like is that it's made of cardboard and it's very hard to assemble. It's hard to put together and it's not going to stay together for long. I've bought several other sets and this one was the first one I bought. The colors are a little off but it's perfect. It is well made and it's very well made.,0
but still enjoyable!  The story is well done and the characters are believable!  I would recommend this DVD to anyone who is interested in the film and the characters. This is a great movie.

"Year of the Unicorn is my favorite Witch World novel among the many five-star novels in this series by Lifetime Grand Master of Fantasy, Andre Norton (Alice Mary North).  Each setting, each character is illuminated with clear description and color, like scenes from a medieval Book of Hours.  Even though I first read this book in 1965, I can still close my eyes and see Gillan and the ancient Dame Alousan gathering herbs in the high-walled garden of Norstead Abbey.  I can see the twelve and one high-born maids riding forth from the Abbey  the twelve and one maids who were promised as brides to the Were-riders of the Waste.

The heroine, Gillan realizes that she is not meant for the quiet life of her vowed companions.  She possesses a magic that is forbidden to the goodly Dames, and a restless curiosity that is stifled behind the stone walls of the Abbey.  And so she rides forth, disguised as the bride who had threatened to kill herself rather than marry a Were-rider.  In order to survive, Gillan must rely on her unschooled magic to separate illusion from reality, and true love from the snarling masks of the Were pack.

Year of the Unicorn is a grand adventure, a love story, a coming-of-age novel set like a jewel amidst the fantastical Dark and Light of Nortons Witch World. Unicorn veers away from the mainstream WW adventures of the Tregarth family (Witch World, Web of the Witch World, Three Against the Witch World, etc.), but it is perfect in its own setting (the Wastes and Dales of High Hallack), and in its own right.",1

"Oh, my, this is so much fun.  My grandson is at my house playing with this toy right now.  When you push the center gear, all of the lights start flashing, music plays, and the gears (if they are still on the monkey) start spinning.  What I like about the toy is that the gear mechanism spin whether or not the gears are on or off and my grandson can put them on and pull them off without stopping the unit.  He loves monkeys, so this toy is perfect for him.

While I like learning toys, sometimes you just want a fun toy to play with.  This one accomplishes both - it is really fun and there is an opportunity to learn colors and improve fine motor control.  The inside gears are in the same colors as the flashing lights.  The outside gears are in similar colors.  You can play match the colors or you can mix them up on purpose.  I also noticed that the little balls that come with his other toys can sit atop the spinning gears and the balls spin, too!  Add to that the gears and knobs are just the right size for his one year old hands and he likes to chew them as he is now teething his last two canine teeth (he's already got 14 of his teeth) and the gears seem to hit just the right spot for those last two.

The toy is a lot more fun that I expected and I would not hesitate to give it as a gift or to buy for the little one in your life.",1

The bracket design for the hot air tool is not very good as it has the tendency to eject the tool if not fully pushed in.

The iron is capable of using Hakko tips but the element cover is tight on some of the tips due to the venting holes being punched in.  Using a drill to de-burr the element cover resolved the issue.

"This set includes 5 different animals that are on the endangered species list.  There is a black rhinoceros, manatee, giant panda, cheetah, and albatross.  The animals all have great detail. The wrinkles on the rhino and manatee are realistic.  They are well made from a thick plastic.  The set also comes with an activity guide.  The activity guide gives lots of great information about each of the animals in the set.  It gives information like why the animal is endangered, where they live, and special characteristics.  It also gives discussion starters and a couple of activities.

I opened it up and my son immediately asked questions.  He started to name the couple he knew.  I corrected or helped with the couple he didn't know.  We talked about the animals and a little about each.  I told him they are all endangered and of course he asked what that meant.  We talked a little about them, but mostly he just likes to pretend play with them.  He was pretending today that the manatee was swimming really fast and then he broke his tail so he was swimming slow and then it got better and he went fast.  Such a 4 year old play game.  There is so much play that can happen with these animals.  Pretend play is such a valuable skill to learn and why not add in some other learning.

  The Jumbo Endangered Animals are for ages 2 years and up.  I really think they can be used for many years.  There are so many learning uses for these animals.  Any child that likes animals would love these.  They would make a great gift.",1
"I normally use a Noizfree headset, which has stellar sound quality.

This one drops out the lower frequencies, and even the remaining ones just sound vastly off.. It's very hard to listen to music with this thing with all the distortion and missing frequencies.  Tried different levels of volume on both the unit and the phone.

Even plugging my noizfree set into the unit and bypassing the neckloop makes very little difference.  The neckloop is mono as expected, but the jack is stereo capable.

I suspect something is off with their bluetooth implementation.. it sounds like an AM radio.  Even given the limitations of Bluetooth audio, the unit itself feels and sounds cheap.

The volume control on the side is audibly noisy, when you change volumes you can hear it scratching.

As others have noted, pairing can be a pain... it did work with a Galaxy S3 and S4 after a few attempts.",1

"I bought this flashlight early december 2015. In recent months I've been using it at work and it has been dropped and tossed around in dusty crawl spaces. I wanted a flashlight that could use my old 18650 batteries that I won't use anymore for my e-cig.

Battery life seems alright. I pretty much always use the light on high and the 18650's i'm using are old and don't last nearly as long as it could with a fresh one. If you're battery is dying it will still allow you to use the low or medium brightness until it can't handle it anymore.

I've had this flashlight fall a few times with some falls taking little chunks of metal off it. I noticed other owners experiencing it not working after a drop. Luckily the one I have took the falls like a champ.

This flashlight is very bright. I'm not a flashlight enthusiast but when climbing into crawl spaces and peering through dark drop tile ceilings it really lights it up. I really like using the zoom feature when looking around. It will illuminate even the furthest darkest corner I would need it to.

Some cons for this light would be it can get hot quick depending on the temperature around you. The zoom markings are pretty silly and I don't think anyone uses it. The brightness and strobe settings are kind of annoying to deal with. If you skip the brightness you want you have to cycle it back again and if you turn the light off too quick it looses your setting.",1
"Bought this for our 11 lb. Lab. It is a little heavy for him, but he doesn't mind it. The bed is solid and is easy to clean. The material is nice and soft and it is easy to clean. The size is perfect for our pup. Great for the price. I have a German Shepherd and a German Shepherd mix. I've had this for about a year now and I love the fact that it's made of a durable, tough material that doesn't crack or tear. The smaller size does, however, feel a bit small for a German Shepherd, and the larger size doesn't hold a lot of weight. It's also made of some other sort of plastic, so I don't know why the material feels like it's made of a plastic. I have to give it a 5 for the price. I wouldn't go wrong with this one. It's very durable. I would recommend this for a German Shepherd. I love this food. I have been feeding it to my cats for about 2 years now.",0

"Bought these for my husband. His CamelBak tube got gunky or something and I thought this would be an easy way to give him a couple replacement tubes and cleaning equipment. He decided to use the water bladder too and it fit nicely into his 2L backpack, did not taste funny, and did not leak with several days of use. He also had no trouble using the lid and refilling the bladder, but both of ours have similar openings so we're used to this kind vs. the ones with openings on the top, which do seem a little more convenient. You have to make sure you close the lid properly and tightly on this kind or there will be leaks, regardless of who made them.

The cleaning equipment worked really well and was pretty ingenious. I only give it minus one star because my husband preferred his old bite valve and there was a crack on one of the yellow levers on theirs. It still works, but makes me wonder how long it can really last. My husband was able to swap in his Camelbak bite valve with this one though, so it wasn't too big a deal.",1

"I recently purchased this after picking way too many apples.  Knowing I had a lot of peeling ahead, I thought this would be a wonderful solution.
It turned out to be a complete waste of money & time.
The plastic is flimsy, the handle pops off while you are turning it, and the suction cups on the base are weak.
One of their selling points is ""the spring loaded blade peels the apple skin in one continuous motion"", but when the handle keeps popping off that means a lot of stopping & restarting.
They likely did this 'assemble at home' so it would fit into a smaller box.  Would have been well worth it to have a larger box & the handle attached to the peeler so you really could peel in one continuous motion.
The peeler does work...just not very well.  In my opinion, there are others listed here on Amazon that are better constructed and would do a much better job for just a few dollars more.  I did not realize something this simple would require researching before buying but now I know!",1

So we found out we needed some tools, this had good reviews and we purchased it. One thing you notice when handling it is that this is very sturdy with some weight on it. The edges are not dull either. While I don't believe they are the sharpest edge you could get, they feel like they could cut through some stuff. I am thinking we might sharpen the edges.

I believe having this tool in hand will be very helpful. I'll try to update after we have used it on our hides.",1

"This kit comes with everything you need to polish metal. I took the guards and grinding wheels off an old 6"" grinder I had. I installed the buffing wheels and had the machine buffing parts in only a few minutes.

It comes with roughing blocks for course, fine, and extra fine. I didn't notice a brown block since it looked like I got two grey blocks; not a big deal for me since the three grits do exactly what I need. If you are doing jewelry, then you need the extra fine that this kit provides, but the fine will be enough to finish most general polishing. Because there are three different grades of roughing blocks, the kit also comes with three different grades of buffing wheels. You need these to keep from mixing the grits of the roughing blocks onto the same wheels.

The instruction manual is clear on how to use the kit and to get a good polish. It also shows which roughing grades to use on which metals.

So far I have polished about 23 steel, brass, and iron parts with great results. I also buffed plastic parts; one of which were the plastic headlights on a car. This kit had them looking almost new.

I am very happy with this kit and glad I didn't spend the money to buy the items separately.

UPDATE: Its been 1.5 years since I started using this kit. I have used it so much that the wheels now need to be replaced and I need more roughing blocks. So, I just bought another one of these kits on sale since it was cheaper than buying all the parts separately. I have buffed so many things that I wonder how I ever got along without it before. I even cleaned up some of my wife's jewelry.",1

"I'm so glad I finally sprang for a Fluke meter.  My old Radio Shack model was giving me very unreliable readings, and was very slow.  This thing is extremely fast and I have to assume accurate.  I use it for home electronics work -- measuring AC and DC current, voltage, continuity, and so forth.  The build quality is excellent.
There is a very similar model for automotive use, but it doesn't provide accurate measurements for very small voltage and current, so not appropriate for electronics work.
There are also two other models in this line: the 175 which is just less accurate as far as I can tell, and the 179 which also offers a temperature sensor.
It's a little hokey the way the stand snaps against the main unit - sort of an uncomfortable friction fit -- and even when extended there isn't really a point where it snaps or cleanly stops.  It feels cheap but there may be a good reason they did it this way, perhaps it stands up better to heavy use and is less likely to break.
I also think it would have been nice to have an ON/OFF button, rather than have to rotate the dial all the way around to the left every time you want to turn it off.  There is an auto-off feature so you can just not turn it off if you want, though you'll use your battery up faster.
The leads that are provided are not premium - which is unfortunate considering the price of the device.  The wires are just not as pliable as I'd like, in that they want to retain their folded-up shape.  So I have ordered a set of more expensive replacement leads.
Also they don't provide any sort of alligator clips or any other attachment for the leads - just the bare metal points.  So again, I had to order those separately.

"When the MH dolls first came out I thought. ""With the way they pop on and off, why not do them all like this and make them interchangeable?""  yeah great idea right?  No, not when Mattel is being greedy. I made the mistake of buying almost everyone of these kits. God Help Me!  I got completely ripped off. They are cheap, the wigs look like crap, the arms and legs are loose, and the hip joints break with little movement. I cant believe that Mattel has gotten so cheap. I mean first the first set of MH dolls end up breaking like crazy, then this?  Come on Mattel don't you have enough money????? Do you really have to rip off us parents this close to Christmas????  This set was NOT worth the money, and I didn't pay hardly anything for it at the store. None of these sets are worth a flip. I might as well toss them ALL in the trash or had just set my dollars on fire in the store. I will be very cautious in buying ANYTHING new from Mattel that is MH. So parents just beware. If you buy any of these kits just know that you are getting half of what you pay for, if that. What is next?  A pile of crap with the MH logo on it?  Really Mattel, really?  This set is even worse than the others and I bought them all unfortunately! The wings won't stay on, none of the torsos look good with any of it. The wig is cheapy, it looks like crap. the dress looks like it is cheap and it isn't even. The velcro is off to the side and you can see it from the front. It just looks terrible. The legs and arms, like all of the others, won't stay on. So just save your money, just wait for the real doll.",1

"My pig/cow obsession started while I was in cosmetology school, and I was searching for timers that didn't look the same as every other student. It has carried on to this day, and I still have a love for unique little items like this, that I don't see anyone else having.
These little big salt and pepper shakers are really cute, and well made. They easily stand on their own and make such a cute little set!
The noses come off to allow the inside to be filled, and the opening was large enough that filling them was very easy.
The silicone noses are brightly colored and although they are easy to remove when you want to, they DONT slide off any other time. To remove, you simply slide a fingernail under the side and peel it up.
I was a little hesitant about the size of the holes. I feel like they could be made just a tiny bit bigger, BUT I personally have 2 kids and DO appreciate that they can use these without worrying about them dumping too much seasoning on their food. If I decide to widen the holes then I know it will be easy because of the silicone.
I have put these through the dishwasher with no issue, although I do not plan (or really foresee a need) to do it again.

All in all, these little piggy shakers are a really adorable little set, and very well made. They made a great addition to my kitchen and I would recommend them to anyone who is looking to replace any other boring salt and pepper shakers!

"Sick & Stupid Score:  6/9*

More of the current national neurosis that is gripping the Ritalin Generation:  Your memories are not your own; you have no idea who you are; an evil force is controlling your life.  And way more of the feminist fantasy that girls can be as tough as boys.  More escape-and-capture sequences than a 1930's cowboy and Indian Saturday matinee movie.  More ""Blade Runner""-style racial diversity than ""Blade Runner.""  More computer-generated graphics than....

When will these awful movies ever end?

* The Sick & Stupid Score ranks movies from zero to ten in each category. For example, a Sick & Stupid Score of 5/5 indicates the movie is about average Sick and about average Stupid.

"Ok, this is one of those bias reviews that people write about.  For example, a huge Aerosmith fan may write about how great they were and are, going on how Aerosmith is the greatest band in history, blah blah blah.  But when one is talking of professional wrestling, the first name that pops in peoples minds is Hulk Hogan.  With that, he is the greatest, biggest, and most popular name in the history of sports entertainment.  I could care less about his technical wrestling skills, because we all know that pro wrestling is fake and how good of a technical wrestler someone is has no effect on the outcome of the match.  So, charisma, charisma, charisma is where it's at and no one had more or better charisma than Hulk Hogan.  I have watched this on more than one occasion.  It is money well spent.  I would have easily paid 100 bucks for this, but thankfully it was no where near that expensive.

The only downside of this DVD is the lack of biographical material.  But it makes up for that with tons of matches.  The overall match selection was really good.  It covers matches from way back during his first run in the WWE in the late 70's to his championship run in the 80's and early 90's to the WCW/NWO days all the way up until his last match with Randy Orton last year.  The DVD was only missing one or two matches that I personally liked a lot.  Those were the matches with Earthquake from Summerslam 90 and the match against Sid Justice from Wrestlemania VIII.  These two matches really showed the ovation Hogan commonly recieved, but amplified many times due to the circumstances.

My personal favorite was the match with The Iron Sheik from January 1984, where it really all began.",1

This this is HUGE and holds up well.  The two large bowls are just the right size.  The top is a nice bright color and is easy to clean.  I would definitely recommend this product.  Highly recommend it.I have two dogs and this is the only litter box I have found that does not break down and is very easy to clean.  It has a very nice smell and does not smell like a regular litter box.  I will buy another one for my two dogs to get their nails trimmed.  I use this litter box with my two small dogs and this one with my two large dogs.  The one with the dogs is a little smaller than I expected but it is still well worth the money.This is a great product for getting your dog to go in and out of the crate.  I have a 10 year old Lab and he is not quite as aggressive as I thought he would be.  He is very active and has not gotten into fights with other people.  I have used this product for a few months now and he seems to be able to get used to it.  It is easy to set up and I can see how much it will help with his training.  It is also easy to clean up.  I will buy another one for my other dogs and they both like it.  I will definitely order it again.It's a great toy for our small dogs.  I like that it's made from solid wood and not heavy duty plastic. ,0

"I bought this vacuum cleaner 3 months ago and absolutely love it!! I am 69 and have a lot of difficulty maneuvering my heavy Kenmore canister vacuum anymore. I have had other stick or similar size vacuums before, but always ended up being disappointed in their performance. Not this one!! This machine is very light but does a fantastic job at picking up dirt in spite of its size. I like the fact that the ""footprint"" is not wide like the usual uprights as it can do a better job of going in tight spaces. I like the transparent cup which is easy to empty without getting dirty hands in the process, the fact that you do not need to buy paper filters, the easy to disassemble construction if you want to give it a thorough cleaning. I also like the sponge type of filter that you just need to rinse thoroughly when too dirty. I actually bought additional filters in case I needed to do soso I would not have to wait for it to dry. The first time I used it I was shocked at the amount of dirt and cat hair I amassed! This was the only time so far I have had to disassemble and clean the inner tube. You know you have to do so because you notice that the suction then is poor.
As you can see, I am tickled pink! This is the perfect vacuum for seniors or small apartments.
The only thing which would make it better: a handle on the front at the cup height to help hold it when vacuuming say stairs or sofa.  A hose attachment would be nice too but can be easily be done without the old fashion way (broom/ brush and rag) For the price and the performance and ease I do not believe it would be fair to remove a star.

"Its a good stand for infrequent repair work. Arrived early and assembled in about 10 minutes. Looks sharp and professional and the color is a nice touch and it feels very sturdy.

However I did experience some things that I did take a star from.
1. The bolt that supports the clamp came slightly bent. Trying to figure out if its worth taking and putting it in my vise to bend back or call park tool and do the return dance. Its not a severe bend, but when under load it is clearly visible but not sagging too much

2. The clamp rotating mechanism on mine tends to stick. I am chalking this up to needing some lubrication in the top to allow some more movement.

3. The legs do not fold up into a contraption that allows them to stay. The kind of flop around. A nite-ize might solve this and clean this up, but how hard would it be to include a plastic piece to put on the stand to keep the legs together?

I honestly expected a bit more from Park Tool. If the bolt is bent from a default then I get that, but I bought this stand and spent more money since I didn't want what looked like Chinese knockoffs and the quality that I know and come to love with Park Tool. This is a great stand to use when I am cleaning my bike after a ride or doing some adjusting, but I would be weary to doing some hard core wrenching on this due to the clamp. I am just getting into MTBing so this will suit me fine, but serious and seasoned riders might want to look to a PCS-10 or another step up stand. This one will be fine for now for novice guys wanting to tinker on their bike and don't mind some of the shortcomings.",1

"This is the first Furby we've had in our house. I was determined not to get caught up in the melee of getting one. But I stumbled across on at Costco at a great price so I picked it up for my 9 year-old daughter for Christmas. We have had a lot of fun with it even though it can get pretty obnoxious at times! It is funny how it progresses and it can change personality. But if you are aware of that feature, it makes it okay, especially if you know how to control the personalities.

This one is a nice set of blues and the amount of animation and movement is impressive for robotic toy in the price range that I paid ($30). So we will have fun with it and since it 'evolves' it will hopefully last longer than some other toys that disappear in a week.

As an adult, I'm fascinated to wake it up at times and see what it says. As long as I know how to turn it off when I'm tired of hearing the barrage of speech... then we are all good. My daughter has had fun as well.",1

"If you aren't able to open the door for your dog all day - or can't get there fast enough while potty training - this is a really good solution for the price. The color matches my old aluminum door perfectly and it took my 4.5 month old puppy learned to use it in about 5 minutes. He really seems to love it. MOST IMPORTANT: unless you have a brand new sliding door and live in Southern California, plan on buying different weather stripping. I used expanding weather seal tape made by M-D (http://www.amazon.com/M-D-Building-Products-03100-Compressible/dp/B007NG6IJ6) on all the sides and top of the panel and it solved the gapping/draft issues (my aluminum sliding door is about 70 years old and it's not exactly still square). You could also use a less expensive foam weather seal tape, but I think this one seals/insulates much better in extreme temperatures. My puppy is tall (labradoodle) and about 35 pounds right now and I'm glad I got the extra large door because it will accommodate his growth and gives him extra height for jumping in while he's little and awkward. When you measure for the panel, the total height should include the recessed space of the track where the door fits. I measured wrong: the entryway height of my door is about 80 inches, but the height including the recessed track (where the door fits) is about 82 inches (which is not a standard size) so this didn't quite fit. To fill the gap between the upper surface of the recess and the top of the door, I used the M-D expanding weather seal tape and it worked great.",1

"The prduct description for these toys says they are ""ecologically responsible"".  I personally don't think killing animals for leather is an ecologically responsible action.  If you love your pets enough to buy them lots of nice toys, then you're an animal lover like myself.  If you love animals as much as I do, then you're probably a vegetarian and don't use animal products like leather.  When I purchased these cat toys I was not aware that they were made with leather because the product description omits this detail.  As soon as I opened the box from Amazon and saw the genuine leather fish heads I was absolutely furious!  Why on earth would I want one animal to suffer - a cow used for its hide - so that I can provide a play toy for another animal - my cat?  I would never kill a cat to use its hide to make a toy for a cow!!

I did end up keeping the toys because I didn't want to deal with returning them - which would also be ecologically irresponsible with the resources going in to the shipping process.  Also, one of my cats absolutely loves feather toys which was the main reason I purchased these in the first place, so I gave him the fishies and he loves them.  They aren't the most popular toys in the kitty basket, but they haven't gone unused.  If my cats are really hyper and I toss the fishies in the air for them they will go after them, but if the toys are just laying there the cats don't go up to them and start playing with them.

I would not recommend these toys to a friend and I would not purchase them again.  If, however, the materials were changed to a faux leather or other man-made material, I would be happy to give a better review/rating.",1

"It's funny how one goes through life without having an item that when you finally get it, you wonder how in the world you lived without it! Well, that's how it is with a block plane. Being somewhat of a power tool snob, I normally don't turn to hand tools when working a project. I saw a relevant YouTube video extolling the virtues of hand planes and noticed that the master woodworker's wall was filled with planes of all sizes and shapes. It got me to wondering what I was missing. I already had a #4 plane squirreled away in my work bench, but this master craftsman convinced me that I needed a block plane. So I got this one.
Once it arrived, I did the standard ""tune up"" by getting the packing coatings removed, adjusting the blade, and sort of checking the flatness of the shoe. All was well.
I had a project going at the time with several half-lap joints where the ends extended a little proud beyond the edge. End grain! Yikes! That's not going to machine well. And I want to use a 1/4"" round over bit with my router, but before I can do that, I need to take that end grain protrusion down to flush with the other surface. Block plane to the rescue! A few quick swipes with a very light cut and it looked perfect with no breakout on the grain. I am a happy camper. I also picked up a stone and honing guide, since now I'll be using my planes a lot more. Next step is to get a few diamond honing stones in finer grits and get really serious about having insanely sharp tools.",1

"Going To Pieces""The rise and Fall of the Slasher""
This is a MUST HAVE for any Slasher,Horror or Gore hound.
It traces the controversial roots of the Slasher all the while showing interviews with Horror icons ,Make up artists,directors etc,.

It also shows some of the best and goriest scenes form some of the best slasher flicks from the 60's to the present.
I have watched it so many times and each time I see something new that I missed the first time,it also pays special attention to the films that have  become classics and discusses the reasons why they are so endeared and have stood the test of time.
It's the best compilation of horror gore clips I have ever seen in one movie.",1

"It does what it says - it provides a stable mount for up to two 2.5"" drives in a regular internal hard drive slot. Here are the problems:

It's not compatible with the newer ""toolless"" cases that use posts rather than screws to secure the hard drive. The posts will not fit through the holes. Luckily, thermaltake does provide all the screws you need - just pop the posts out of your hard drive tray or mounting bracket and replace with the larger of the two sizes of screw they provide.

It is also difficult to access the screw hols for the lower of the two drives in this mount. If you need to mount two drives, do the lower one first, and find a small screwdriver.

Finally, the connectors for the hard drive will be recessed about one inch into the bay compared to the rest of the drives. If you have a small or a very populated drive bay, it will be difficult to access those connectors, and if you have the angled SATA connectors, you will not be able to connect two drives in this bay, at least one drive will need a straight SATA connector.

I only needed it to mount one hybrid SSD/HDD, but I do like knowing that even though it will take some effort, I can mount a second 2.5"" drive if I need to.",1

"2013-08-04 Update - They worked great for about a month.  Two weeks ago, the one side stopped working. It works at the beginning of the run, the stops after about 2 miles.  It will work again the next day.  I have tried everything.  Once, on a longer run, it did restart towards the end of the run.  This was my first, and now last, Philips purchase.  I just don't understand how the quality control could be so poor.

Original Review
Have been trying to find an inexpensive headset like the Nike pair that I had and loved.  These are not as inexpensive as the Nikes but if they last longer, they will be worth it.

I like them and plan to stick with these - have had to return a couple of types I recently bought.  The sound is good, not  great, but for running and podcasts its what I need.  They are very comfortable.  You can wear them both over and under the ear, which is really nice. The cord gets in the way a bit if you wear your phone/mp3 on your arm but there is clip that helps keeps it out of the way.  The cord is a good length if you are keeping the phone/mp3 in your pocket.",1
"As a big fan of the early James Bond, I have tried to continue to enjoy the series of movies that followed the Sean Connery reign as Bond. These latter day movies with actors other than Connery (exception, Roger Moore) are just not satisfying to the older Bond fan. Judi Dench makes a very good ""M"" and Daniel Craig is almost believable as Bond. The story line is engaging. Waste your time on it if you cannot find any other movie that jumps out at you (to watch).",1

"Have had this belt for a year now. It is by far my favorite. The belt looks better as time passes but it is still passing for business casual with a nice pair of jeans and a dress shirt. Read a review that someone gave it back because the color was too light... that's a shame. They should have just waited. It will age and darken. You could apply any leather polish - for example the stuff for leather bicycle seats or baseball gloves - to darken it a shade instantly.
Give this one a shot. You won't regret it. I too grew tired of buying $20 junk Chinese made belts that looked good for about 5 days before starting to disintegrate.
I'll be back to this Orion company to pick up a black belt for dressier occasions eventually.",1

"I have just quit reading Nelson DeMilles The Gold Coast. In 175 pages of rather well written prose about a rich woman I could never stand and from the viewpoint of her passive-aggressive attorney husband living in a snobby neighborhood of the famous Gold Coast of west Long Island, New York, let me tell you what happened.

Other than the narrator getting his ashes hauled a few times by his kinky, often emotionally unavailable wife, expressing a massively slow burn about his Mafia Don new neighbor, and the worlds shortest mid-life crisis, nothing has happened. Let me repeat that. NOTHING. He has described rich home after rich home, and some pleasant pieces of New York society historydropping a few names we know like Rockefeller, Rothchilds and so onother than that, zilch. Bupkis.

I do like the quietly snarky sense of humor he shows us but seldom shows the other characters, but other than that? This book is a waste of my time and yours. So, after reading it about a quarter of the way through, and it is a chubby book, I got pissed and pitched it up against the wall then rethought and put it in my bag for charity shops.

"It was delightful watching this old film, black and white, bad transfer and all.

Four bad guys are on their way to East Africa to secure a deal with uranium mines. Their agent is Billy (Humphrey Bogart) a man who is a ""typical rare spirit."" His wife is Maria (Gina Lollobrigida). They meet a British couple who are also on their way to Africa. Gina falls for the husband Harry (Edward Underdown) while Harry's wife Gwendolen (Jennifer Jones) falls for Billy. They are stranded in Italy as the boat is in need of repairs and the captain is always full of spirits.

Jennifer Jones steals this film as a fast thinker with an over active imagination who is prone to lying in every situation. The dialouge, in part written by Truman Capote, reflects national stereotypes that translate into today's world as well as clever oxymorons, mispronounced words and misused phrases. It is film in which you want to pay close attention to the words. The bad guys are quite the lot. Peter Lorre plays Julius O'Hara, claiming ""There are a lot of German O'Hara's from Chile."" Maj. Jack Ross (Ivor Barnard) spouts off his love for Hitler and Mussolini along with wild conspiracy ideas. Would make for a wicked remake.",1

Still very good for the price, and it is easy to guess at how long the battery needs to be charged for and then just unplug it when you think that it is done.",1

"Troy is a Chicago cop who has been with the FBI for a long time. She's just starting to get into the detective business, and she is running out of ideas. She's been with the FBI since she was a teenager, and she's learned how to handle the FBI. She's a woman who's lost the most of her self-confidence and self-esteem. She's a very smart, independent woman, and she's on a mission to find the killer. She's determined to find him, and the only way she knows how is to go undercover.

I enjoyed the book and the characters, and I was a little confused at first. It took awhile for me to get used to the whole mystery. I loved how the author didn't let us read all of the clues and the little details that she made into a book. I found myself wanting to know what was going to happen next.

It was a great read, and I really enjoyed the characters. The main character, Colton, was very interesting, and I found myself rooting for him to find the killer. It was a great read, and I would recommend it.

"I'm really enjoying this lens. It's been an excellent choice, and has given me a lot more options than just my Nikon 50mm 1.4 D prime. I use it as my all-time walk around lens now.

Pros:

Construction quality is great. No dust in the lens, built big and tough. I took it camping with me and it held up great.
VC is fantastic. Not too loud for me. I like that I can hear it put itself into action.
Photos are sharp and clean.
Low light photos are no problem.
The lens lock button works well so the lens doesn't creep, but don't really need it. The zoom ring is tight enough to hold it.
Lens is easy to operate in manual focus mode too.
Price price price! Much less expensive when compared to the Nikon counterpart that doesn't have VC.

Cons:

Focus is not prime-lens-fast, but definitely quick enough to get the fast shot off  (just comparing to my prime 50mm 1.4).
Doesn't focus well on far away mountains / clouds. Sometimes the focus has a hard time locking on to things my prime has no problems with.
The lens is big, does add size and weight to my Nikon D300, but it balances well on the body.

My photos with the lens are here: [...]. I label the photos with tags on the right, so you know which lens was used.

I highly recommend this lens.",1
"I really love these night lights! They are slim, visually appealing, and very bright without being glaring. My old night lights had the sensors mounted on top, which could present problems when used in locations under kitchen cabinets or other areas that were ""shaded"". The senors on these lights are in the center and work no matter how they are plugged in. I like to use mine in the top receptacle, leaving the bottom one free for plugging in other things. This also makes the 3 way switch easily accessible from the top. Yes!!! I did say 3 way switch! You have the options of two brightness settings, and can turn the unit off without unplugging it. This is so very handy for me because I work nights and don't need to leave things lit up while I am at work. If you want access to the top receptacle, and don't need easy access to the switch, you can flip it over and plug it into the bottom. Easy!!! The ""HIGH"" setting really lights up my bathroom for those nocturnal visits. I never liked to turn the lights in in there if I am half-awake and plan on jumping back in bed after the deed is done.

Some people may not like being able to see the separate LEDs glowing in the ring, but I find it to be very decorative. I also like the bluish glow they give out much better than a glaring white or yellow light. Place a few of these in some strategic locations, and you'll have no trouble navigating through your darkened house at night. Fumbling in the dark for the light switch will be a thing of the past. You get two for this great price. Have a basement? Get at least two more! Two of these has replaced four of the old style lights for me. I'll never go back!

"Watching a friend's vacation slides may be an agreeable way to spend an evening, but Laurie R. King tests readers' patience with the same technique when she sends Mary Russell and her husband, Sherlock Holmes, to ""The Moor.""

The title refers to Dartmoor, nearly 400 square miles of fields, hills and treacherous marshes in the southwest of England. Conan Doyle set ""The Hound of the Baskervilles"" there, and King uses a rumored reappearance of the hound as the pretext for drawing her sleuthing couple there. They're summoned by the eccentric clergyman, author and hymn writer (""Onward Christian Soldiers"") Sabine Baring-Gould, now nearly 90 and in failing health.

But before the inquiry gets underway, we're given a long dissertation from Mrs. Holmes about Baring-Gould and Dartmoor. Between the suspicious death of a local who wandered off the straight and familiar and the discovery of a body in the good minister's lake, there's nearly 200 pages of Russell reading Baring-Gould's books, Russell talking with the man and Russell riding about the countryside and chatting up the locals. Getting to the heart of the hound mystery takes up the last hundred pages, with remarkably little of the suspense which the novel advertises.",1

Many times I have felt uncomfortable when wanting to address something with one of my employees. This book has been invaluable to me in that it has given me a lot to think about and put into action. I like that there is a timeline so there are different questions to ask myself each day so that I just don't do a 180 in 24 hours. My employees may just walk out on me then!

This book really made me identify to myself why I am the boss, what skills I possess to help this business and to take ownership of that. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to work on their management skills!

"The two Michael Powell directed pictures in CLASSIC BRITISH THRILLERS give good indication of the great work he'd produce later, although they are somewhat hampered by small budgets. The James and Pamela Mason murder mystery is quite engaging.

SYNOPSES--

THE PHANTOM LIGHT--  The lighthouse keeper at a quaint Welsh coast village dies mysteriously, and his lighthouse is now supposedly haunted-- an unexplained light keeps shining on the scene of his death. The story's atmosphere is literal, with lots of blanketing fog, plus a murder mystery that's equally shrouded and obscured. Primarily filmed within a lighthouse, this whodunit has more than its share of ethnic humor.

RED ENSIGN--  Leslie Banks plays a somewhat pushy manager of a shipyard whose revolutionary boat design encounters much opposition and skullduggery from the competition and his own financers.

THE UPTURNED GLASS--  A story told in flashback. Neurosurgeon's affair with a married woman ends with her defenestrated death. Suspecting the woman's sister is involved, the surgeon plots revenge on her. Easily the best of this small collection. Co-written by Pamela Mason.

"In <i>Tempting Her Fake Fiance</i> we meet Stasia, a small newspaper reporter and blogger, who has just come out of a divorce. She is in Las Vegas getting an interview with the highly sought after Evan Stone. Evan is grappling with issues concerning his family needing him to be the man of the house when he meets Stasia. His guilt is what catapults him into the idea of faking their engagement, while in turn helping her build more confidence and shoving it in her ex-husbands face publicly. I thought the premise behind the story was great, but when it came down to it it kind of did play out just like a Lifetime Romance movie to me. Now as I say that it doesn't mean that the story wasn't cute, but it was just cute to me.  It had some juicy X rated scenes, but all in all it was mostly a demure chemistry between the two, that turned into a lovely love story. In the end the two will end up finding something that neither of them expected or really wanted.",1

"I purchased this pan for my wife and she loves it.  She also loves the fact that it is so small.  I am using it for the first time in a 4x6 pan.  It is perfect for a small kitchen.  I love how it keeps the food warm and a bit cold for a short time.  I have made a batch of cookies and they are very cute.  I have not used it for any other type of cookie making, so I don't know how it will hold up.  I am very happy with it.  I have a larger pan, but it is perfect for my needs.  I would highly recommend it.This is a great product.  I have to say it is not the most durable liner",0
"Reading this book is like reading an academic biography, which is a boring book. I am not a major fan of the book.

"My daughter likes the 2012 Barbie Holiday Doll . She said that the doll is very pretty because of the ""more dramatic makeup"", and her hair comes curly which is fairly unusual.

"I'm a Buffy novice. Watching only the movie last year, I had successfully avoided the Buffy phenom year after year. Perhaps it was the undue influence of a certain person that worshipped the shows as the best thing on. But it took my current boyfriend to turn me on to the Slayer and her gang of do-gooders that has made me a complete convert. I stand in the awe of Buffy.
Since I have no other seasons with which to compare this first season, I must say this is a delectable, funny group of episodes. Setting the course of the show, Sarah Michelle Gellar proves her talent early on, giving Buffy the appropriate menace and high school angst. She clearly carries the show on her shoulders, yet carries that mantle with utmost professionalism. Her cohorts are equally compelling. Alyson Hannigan plays Willow, a self-confessed computer geek, with a sense of wonderful innocence. Nicholas Brendon gives Xander, a loveable loser, dignity.  Anthony Head's Giles, know-it-all librarian, is stuffy and fun.
The twelve episodes stand up well, with only a couple of brain scratchers in the mix. The first two set up the series and its characters very well. Some of the favorites included the ""Angel"" episode, that finally helps solve the mystery of the character while seemingly adding more to it, and ""Nightmares"" where seemingly bad dreams enter reality. One particularly odd episode was ""The Pack"", where hyenas seem to enter a group of students as they proceed to reign havoc over Sunnydale, but I didn't buy it.
Overall, you can see the promise of this series in these early episodes. I was pleasantly surprised at the developing sense of humor that seemed to grow with each episode. I really enjoyed the comraderie between all the main characters, as they fight both those hideous Hellmouth demons and the trials and tribulations of puberty. Overall, it's been an enjoyable experience.
I'm eargerly awating to watch season two on DVD now, and find out what happens to Buffy and her gang!",1

"These motion night lights are the best.

I'm not the one that likes lights running at night, I like it dark to sleep and even a nightlight in the bathroom glowing is too much light for me.  I installed at first one of these in the bathroom and loved it so much I had to buy more packs so we could put one in the kitchen, on the basement stairs, laundry room, and additional bathroom.

The light turns on only when you need it, when your in the room.  The light is plenty bright to see what you are doing in the bathroom (not for reading though) but not too bright to wake you totally up at night.  It turns on and runs for about 45 seconds unless additional motion is detected.

I find myself leaving the lights off when I go into the basement as the motion nightlight is plenty bright enough for me to sagely climb the stairs or walk in the basement without fear of tripping over the pet.

I had some relatives over and one of them commented on the nightlight so much that I ended up giving her one for her own home.  She afterwards commented how much she loved having it.  Simple devices make life so much easier...

PROS:
- Low Voltage LED
- Uses very little power
- Will illuminate a 10x8 bathroom no problem (not a reading brightness though)
- Only on when you want it on
- Bright enough to see what you are doing without waking you up too badly at night
- You'd better buy the multi-pack or you'll be buying again
- Runs for about 45 seconds unless more motion detected
- Have been using now for about 2 years without a failure

CONS:
- Wish I had found these a long time ago (I hated the 7watt nightlights)
- Cat runs by it to see in her litter box (I though they could see well in the dark)",1

So, I bought these and listen to music while I walk. The noise isolation isn't extreme because I can still hear cars coming and my idiot neighbors calling my name. The cord is wicked long it's almost annoying. I got no cable wrap in the box like some other guy on here. They are big and stretch over my big melon head to completely cover my ears. Luckily they look huge so my neighbors can see I have them on and they don't think I'm ignoring them. They weigh nothing some idiots probably think that means they are cheaply made. They are quite well constructed. Get a pair you won't regret it.",1
I have read others in this series and am very pleased with how they handled the situation.  The story is told from the point of view of the heroine and the reader.

The metal part is well made and looks good on my rifle. I would recommend this to anyone.I bought this to replace the one I had installed on my M&P Shield.  It has great features and is great for shooting at range.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it was very easy to install.  The included clip does not fit on the case.  This is a bad design and should be fixed.  The next time I shoot, I'll get another one of these for my Shield.  The belt does not come with the clip.  I had to go to the store to get the clip.  I was going to buy a second one for my Shield, but that was not a deal breaker.  It is good for a little practice but not a great purchase.  The clip is not flexible enough to handle the recoil of a gun.  The metal part is very easy to install and the clip is easy to install and remove.  I would recommend this to anyone who is considering this purchase.I like this because it's a little small for a small back pack, but it's perfect for a long day hike.

The great charcoal for a typical aquarium and value priced. However don't use it on low pH aquariums like Tetra's or Discus as if you have the pH adjusted down this will raise it. I soaked it for a week and rinse before and after the soak to help prevent the pH change but it happened anyway.,1
"I adore the 'Lord Peter' series of books by Dorothy Sayers. I found this to have a darker feel to it than most - perhaps due to the lowering skies under which it's set. The plot is, as ever, complex & well-structured, and you learn a lot on the side (if you wish) about campanology, and about what life could be like in the wet lands of Norfolk. The 'whodunnit' is not in any way obvious (another characteristic of Sayers' writing.) And the characters are beautifully-drawn. This is a book that I've already read several times, and which I'll enjoy as much the next time I turn to it.

Incidentally, the story does not involve clothing or any form of haberdashery.",1

"These ice packs are perfect for my family. We are slowly integrating our children into school after years of homeschooling and now have to deal with sending a lunch - mostly sandwiches or other cold items. I needed something to keep the food cold for just a few hours, but not too bulky either.

These thin, bread size ice packs are perfect. They are less than  thick and like I said the size of a slice of bread. They fit perfectly into a Bento lunchbox we own and even a small metal box. (I have included pictures so you can see.) Plus, being so thin a sandwich or other food items still fit in the container. So many of my other ice packs are bulky and take up so much room I have no space left for the food.

The ice pack stays cool long enough to keep the food chilled until lunch time. And if I feel the food needs some extra coldness, due to the thin nature of the ice pack, I can place one on the bottom and one on the top.

They are easy to clean. I just rinse them off, or if they get quite a bit of food on them, I just wash in some sudsy water. They re-chill quickly in the freezer and are always ready for the next day. Plus, again due to the thinness, they do not take up a huge amount of space in my already cramped freezer. And, the best part, being a hard plastic they do not get holes and leak all over. I have had way too many ice packs leak.

One thing I'd like to add is the ice pack has a ""food"" side and a ""lid"" side. I don't see a difference?

Pros:
Thin (less than  thick)
Size of a slice of bread
Keep food cold for at least 4 hrs.
Hard plastic and do not leak
Easy cleaning
Do not take up a lot of space in the freezer

Cons:
Do not stay cold all day

I was given the ice packs for free in exchange for my opinion and review.",1
"The first delivery arrived with spider web cracks running through it.  The screen protector is glass, and while it is adequately packaged for normal shipping, I suspect that the corner of a box on the delivery truck caught it.  The return process was very quick and easy.  Once I received the replacement, installation was simpler than many plastic protectors I've worked with on other devices.

"First off, I'm a cable cutter, got tired of paying big $$ for basic tv.  Kept my internet so netflix and amazon are my primary movie outlets.

Wanted the antenna for local news/weather and sports.

With that said, I was very skeptical purchasing this contraption...so when it arrived, I was even more nervous as the antenna is literally paper thin with a black and white side!  Anyway, mounted it at the very top of my ceiling to give it every opportunity to succeed (they do give you a nice amount of cable so that you can mount fairly high up) attached end of cable to TV, set to Air, and had the tv do it's air scan and about 2 min later I have over 20+ free channels!  local news, sports, shopping channels, fox, and few others that I'm not really sure what they are...The picture and sound quality is amazing as well...almost as if I had HD cable!

"When I was a child, I devoured Isaac Asimov's books -- especially his Robot and Foundation books, which he ended up combining near the end of his life. As I read WJ Davies' Binary Cycle: Disruption, I found myself going back to those days in junior high and high school, lying on my bed and dreaming of a world different than our own, yet similar in many ways.
The world Davies has dreamed up -- Taran -- is on the brink of disaster. A colony of a dying Earth, it has been left to itself since its founding and planetary forces are threatening its very existence. But, that's just the foundation for the story as Davies interweaves characters through various places on the planet as these disruptions are having different effects -- biological, physical, political -- and the characters are all wonderfully crafted to the delight of this reader.
I really found myself identifying with the character Jonathas as he navigated a disaster area in search of his girlfriend and the new-found technology recently implanted into his bloodstream.
The book ends on a doozy of a note and I am really looking forward to the next installment in this series from Davies.",1

I can't say I've ever had an electrician who didn't need a charge for the first couple of months. I had a friend who was a lifetime electrician who had a lot of experience with electricians and electrical engineers. I was very excited about the idea of using the lithium ion battery and a 2 AAA battery to charge the batteries. I have a lot of experience with electricians and electrical engineers and had to install a lot of batteries on my electrician's old electrician's motor. I wanted to be able to charge the batteries in the same way that I was able to use a battery powered electrician. So I used the Lutron Lithium Ion Battery. I was very impressed with this battery. I also had no issues with the batteries. I like the fact that I can charge the batteries in the same way as the battery powered electrician. I also like the fact that the battery is not a single AA battery. It is a single,0
"This is an intriguing documentary. It doesn't defend the practice of bestiality, but instead makes viewers acknowledge that zoophiles are utterly human, not evil or sinister. This is a story about a group of friends with a disturbing fetish (perhaps even a distinct sexuality, since they don't seem very interested in other humans). When an accident happens and things go too far, their community unravels and people are exploited by the media and shamed by the public. It's a very sad story, but one worth watching. I feel particularly badly for the animal companions who were confiscated or sold away in the aftermath of this event.

There are confusing elements to this documentary, particularly in regards to which interviewee is narrating--I recommend watching it with the subtitles running. It lost me at points. There are definite flaws in the storytelling, but it's still so compelling that I put up with those flaws.

I recommend this film to anyone who is fascinated by sexuality or who seeks to understand outsiders.",1

One thing I noticed is it was recommended for 43"" and smaller tvs. This may be due to length, however I mounted it in the center of the TV with the included wall mount, and if centered properly it looks perfect. It is pretty loud as well, we usually have the volume between 15 and 25 out of 100.  I have the sub turned down and in a corner behind my couch (it just needs a wall outlet) and also sounds good.  The bar itself adjusts with the TV volume which displays on the TV when adjusted. Basically I never have to touch the sound bar or use it's remote (which is a good thing cause I haven't seen it in a month). One caveat with the wall mount is the optical cable plugs in on one side of the mount than has an opening for the wire to go into the wall on the other side. Because of this the optical cable has to be routed under the mount and is slightly visible.",1

I read this book 2nd time. The characters were just too real. There were too many typos. There was a lot of sexual tension and then the sex was soooooooo much that it was like watching a movie. I would read it again. This is my first book from this author. I will continue to read it,0

"After waiting impatiently for months, I finally got the chance to read it.

The premise of the story is simple enough: the story takes place in the beginning of the Third World War, when the British and French were fighting in a war against one another.  The two main characters, Maisie and Marguerite, are young and inexperienced soldiers who are sent to China in search of a place to live and to train for war.  They are assigned to a small town in the middle of nowhere, where the Germans have developed a reputation for being violent, and where the French have been particularly successful.  The village is ruled by a group of young French women who live in a small apartment, and the Germans are at the",0

"Installed this in a split level 1960's era home that has a combination of old 2 wire (non grounded) wiring, and remodeled sections with 3 wire (grounded) wiring. Router is upstairs, and I wanted to hook up an ""Apple TV"", and TiVo downstairs using the Powerline XE104 to cut down on wireless signals that were interfering with my LG Home Theater System's wireless rear speakers and subwoofer (caused annoying sound fade in and out).
  Wiring involved was all in 2 wire part of the house, but on a different circuits. Was able to get an immediate ""downstream"" signal and internet connection going through a 6 outlet (wall) surge protector at the Router end, but only got .5 Mbps throughput speeds downstream (testing speed with laptop and online speed test). Removed the surge protector (as Instructions state), and speed went up to same speed as when the laptop is directly connected to my Netgear (Wireless N) Router. This product is rated at 85 Mbps, but obviously not getting that from my ISP (15 Mbps max.). No need to get Netgear's faster products (200 or 500 Mbps) if you're not getting a lot more than 85 Mbps input from your ISP, right?
  Movie streaming speed to Apple TV is good. Will probably connect the LG BluRay player up too (which can also stream Netflix or Vudu movies wirelessly) once I get a longer Ethernet cable (now using Wireless N with good results).
  One other note: Those that are saying they get two 4 port units must be getting re-packaged or a mis-packaged Kit, as Netgear's specs for the ""XEB1004-100NAS  4-port Powerline 85 Adapter Kit"" specifically states one unit has one ethernet port, and only the receiving unit has 4 ports. Came with 2 5ft. Ethernet cables.  BTW, sound fading problem has disappeared, thanks to this great product!",1

"Inspired by the Allan Ginsberg poem of the same name, HOWL shows the eponymous hero (James Franco) reading the work out lout to a group of fellow-poets in San Francisco.  The work obviously inspired extreme passions: the audience listen in rapt attention to a work that depicts the poet's feelings through an earthy yet compelling idiom.  In an attempt to show how the poem might work, directors Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman introduce a series of animated sequences; none of them try to 'explain' the work, but rather show how Ginsberg's language works associatively, inspiring moods rather than following any logical sequence.  When the work was first published in the mid-Fifities, it was the subject of a famous obscenity trial: Epstein and Friedman restage that trial, showing how the poem was criticized for its apparent earthiness of language, and then cleared on the grounds that Ginsberg was only following the principle of free speech.  HOWL is an enthralling piece, encouraging viewers not to 'understand' the significance of the poem in terms of meaning, but to see it as symptomatic of a particular moment in American history, when old taboos and/or standards of moral or civilized behavior were subject to intense scrutiny.  The conservatism of the early Fifties had been superseded by a new spirit of adventure, encapsulated in Ginsberg's work, that looked forward to the spirit of the Sixties.  James Franco offers a convincing characterization of Ginsberg, supported by memorable cameos from David Strathairn, Jon Hamm, and Bob Balaban as the main protagonists in the court case.",1

"I am surprised at some of the reviews that consider this a small chair.  Although it doesn't feel like a 17th-century King's throne, and although it is recommended to not be used by anyone over 225 lbs, my 6'3"" 200+ lb frame fits into this chair quite comfortable, with space on either side.

This is a comfortable chair, the lumbar support is nice, the air lift works smoothly so far, and it was fairly easy to assemble (it took me 40 minutes from start to finish).  I like that the arms tilt up if you want them out of the way... of course I didn't know this when assembling it and though something was wrong!  I should also mention the metal armrests were both labeled ""J"" (instructions called one ""I"" and one ""J"") and took me awhile to figure out which is which, genius that I am.

The upholstery is a textured brownish-grey, with the metal frame kind of somewhere between a gold/nickel color.... I would think it'd be important to know this going in if your color scheme is important.

For me, the question of whether this chair is worth the $ is its longevity.  Will the upholstery pull or tear easily?  Will the up/down mechanism last?  Etc.  If I think of it I will check in here with an update in 6 months.  One wants a chair like this to last several years, of course, so, we will see.  For now, a solid 4 stars for a major upgrade over my last office chair!",1

"I've used these over the past several years, so have a lot of experience with them.  I switched to them as I couldn't clean the plastic litter boxes completely of odor, and in my small home that's an important consideration.  To boot, I threw away a Litter Robot before settling on these boxes, if that gives a reference point for me using only these.  These are the BOMB - very strong, holds two bags of 18 lb Dr. Elsey's litter at a time (that's how my cats and I like it ;), and the cardboard sides allow the litter to stay drier.  Getting clumps off the walls is easier compared to plastic bins, likely due to the drying effect.  After a month, I bin the entire shebang (one box for two cats lasts an entire month).  I've also used the smaller ones when I travel with my cats.  The boxes are reasonably-priced, and I usually get them from my local Pet Club - but am extremely grateful I can find them for the same price on Amazon with Prime Shipping when my local Pet Club is out of stock.  I literally (""litter-ally""!) don't know if I could've survived having cats without these and the Litter Genie!  Next step - toilet-training the cats.",1

"I bought an 8 pack of these and have been replacing the CFL bulbs in the house as they burn out.  I've been much happier with these.  Sure they are more expensive, but I expect them to last ""forever"".  So especially in those pain-in-the-butt-to-change bulb locations (you know the ones I mean) you want to replace with these.  Also the much lower power is great.  I replaced some old incandescents which were actually overheating themselves, and these are so much better.

I have gotten Cree daylight spectrum for outside the house security lights and it looks amazingly clear.  For inside the house, these Soft/Warm lights are much better, I find, but it's up to personal preference.  They have a nice glow to them rather than the harsh LED light you might be familiar with if you bought some of the earlier or cheap ones.  Try these, you'll love them, save power, and change bulbs much less often.  Win, win, win.",1

"I got a great deal when I ordered this item. In return, I'm making my honest and very reliable information about this queen bed sheet bedding set.

Normally before using a new set of sheets, I washed it first. But with this product I used right away without any hesitation. I can feel it's super soft and made with best quality materials. The sheets are wrinkle free and fits to my queen bed perfectly. It has deep fitted pockets all around so it stays in place and don't slip. It's made of microfiber that will definitely last long.

My husband is very sensitive to dust so I wash/ change our bed linens every week. Hypoallergenic sheet is a PLUS! I was anxious when I threw this Nestl Bedding Set to the washer, thinking it will shrink, pill and wrinkle like my other sheets. But to my surprise, i was wrong! I won't have to deal with sheets pilling and wearing, even with repeated washings. This product is very strong and thick compared to my other sheets. This is way better than my other microfiber sheets. VERY SOFT, COMFORTABLE AND MOST OF ALL VERY EASY TO CARE.

I'm so pleased and so as my husband.",1

"Ever had the feeling while you're reading a book, that you might be sorry you're doing it? That there's something real horrible coming and you don't really dare to enjoy it? I had that feeling the entire time I spent reading this book.

I don't know what I was waiting for. To find I liked one of the characters? Or hated another?

I picked it up because I thought it was some sort of crime novel and then it turned out to be about people - not my usual bag at all.

But I kept reading. It kept me up a few nights, just waiting for the shoe to drop.

And I realized I did like some of the characters. They were all broken in some way and I kind of warmed to them.

And when the shoe dropped I was pleased. And very happy I'd read it.

Not sure I'd like that same experience the next time I pick up a monster story but I definitely dug it this time around.",1

"Overall, 'The Blackwell Files: Volumes 1, 2 & 3' were quite intriguing books. They do need some more editing, but it wasn't so bad that I couldn't follow the stories. 'Nefarious', 'Ruthless' and 'T Wave' were all full of deceit, suspense, thrilling scenarios, romance and an abundance of characters who fit the role of 'bad guys'. Alton and Mallory make such a great team. They truly compliment each other and their strengths make them the ideal couple. David and Fahima are such an awesome couple. Their romance was so endearing. This series had me hooked from the first chapter in the first book and didn't let go. I look forward to reading more.",1

This is made out of nice quality materials, it doesn't hold water and is thin and comfortable for my daughter to wear. As far as sizing goes, this runs pretty on track, i ordered this in a size 6t for my 3 year old who typically wears size 5t/6t and it fits her pretty nicely, she is about 43lbs and 42inches! The straps on this are simple and crisscross in the back, they are also resizable. This is a unique and fun suit, definitely cuter then any suit I've purchased in stores. The little hat that came with this is made out of the same materials as the suit, it is kind of small for my daugh though. Overall I'm really happy with this!!!!

"I read this the first time so many years ago, that I do have to admit I had forgotten so much about the many side stories and characters. Why that should take away from a novel for some readers is beyond me, but everyone has their favorites. I would only say, so many stories in books and movies these days are so pat. I always tease my wife for rushing through her novels, and she's always teasing me for insisting on reading every. single. word, and doing so at a pace I think the author may appreciate. If a book's an easy read, I'll motor through it in a couple hours, but a more dense novel filled with beautiful writing, well, I'll happily go at a tortoise's pace. I bring this up to say, this novel stuck with me for so many years for a reason. Why let yourself get frustrated if the author chooses to take his time? I read this as a child and over the years have loved apocalyptic stories. Some of the more recent blockbuster movies in the genre have greatly disappointed. Lucifer's Hammer was brilliant in that it showed how so many outstanding plans, crafted by sharp people, dedicated to detail, can all fall to, well, you'll see. The guy made homemade beef jerky, stocked his jeep with all the necessary gear, and backup gear of the most important stuff, and was absolutely prepared for the coming disaster.",1

"I am changing my review (shown below). This item is poorly made. After wearing to sleep at night over a 2 week period, it sprung a major leak. I awoke to find my head covered in little white beads. I contacted and returned to Amazon. They sent me another. After 2 weeks, this one is starting to leak. The inner lining is a very poor thin cloth which does not last. Also, the side holes serve no purpose in a wrap around sleep mask.

Unlike some reviews, this is a serious review. It is very comfortable and fits completely over the head. There is a hole in front which will fit leaving my nose and mouth uncovered but covering my eyes. it does reduce sound but does not completely eliminate it. It is not hot. It does not require any straps  for adjustment. Simply pull it on and adjust so that the eyes are covered leaving the mouth and nose open. I can sleep comfortably on my side or back. it comes with a cloth bag for storage.",1
It was nice to read something with action from a woman's point of view.  A great deal of humor as well. I thoroughly enjoyed the book.,1
"This is the best bluetooth keyboard I have ever used. I have one for an ipad mini and it is very durable and works very well. I have no problem with it connecting to my ipad. I don't have to worry about dropping it, (I dropped it a few weeks ago and the case I had on it protected it, but the case broke) that's why I decided to get a more durable case and had always wished I could type like a lap top. It does add some weight to the ipad, but it is worth the weigh for the protection and usage. I love it and would recommend it to anyone.",1

"This is a great respirator. It fits very tightly and securely to my face: I plugged up the intake holes and could not get air in at all, even from the sides of the mask itself.

With the filters in place, breathing is easy. Exhalation is like breathing without a mask, and you can barely tell that there is a little extra work when breathing in.

On top of this, the mask is also pretty comfortable for a respirator. The silicon part that deals to your face is very soft.",1
"I purchased one of these in Navy.  Speedo has outdone themselves, this is the best looking, most comfortable speedo I have seen in a long time.  The suite appears to be well made and the fit is incredible.  The fit is just right not to snug, not to loose.  I will definately purchase more of these, and will feel comfortable wearing them for tanning, at the beach or at the waterpark, they will look good anywhere.
I just purchased two more of these the red and black.  I thought the blue ones being so good might have been a accident but I got to admit the red and black are just as great.  I don't know what they have done to the fabric but I have never felt speedos feel so good next to my body.  There are so many color options they could add in this style I hope they do.  You can not go wrong with these, I usually purchase aussiebum swimwear but these feel better and with less cost.  Keep up the good work speedo and thanks for a GREAT product.",1
"The Darling is a magnificent book, far ranging and very compelling. Russell Banks, like Wally Lamb, writes authentically in the voice of a woman, so much so that it is hard to believe this book was really written by a man.

The woman's voice is that of Hannah Musgrave Sundiata, a.k.a. Dawn Carrington, the darling of the title. What a misnomer! She is anything but darling. Selfish, self-absorbed and admittedly lacking any maternal instinct whatsoever, Hannah is not a sympathetic character, in spite of all she endures, nor even a very likeable one.

This is a story of a political radical's flight to W. Africa and her subsequent marriage to a black Liberian, which results in the births of three children. It is, of course, a tale of politics, race relations, and terrorism. But it is also a story of one woman's efforts to learn about herself and to make a life of value. Whether she ever succeeds at this goal is debatable.

This book made me want to immediately delve into anything written by Russell Banks!",1

"I use this router at the receiving end of a wireless bridge between the two floors of my apartment, and also as a print and file server. I know this unit may be a bit of an overkill for the purpose, but I couldn't find any lower cost alternatives that would provide the same feature set.

I was a bit worried about the speeds I would get through the concrete floor, but the connection to the main router, an Apple Time Capsule, is rock stable at a 866 Mbps signal rate (the signal sits around 47-49 dB against a 92dB noise floor). The connection would stay up for months at a time.

I was pleasantly surprised that the stock firmware supported all the features I needed, but it's still nice to know that I can fall back to Merlin or DD-WRT if I need additional tweaking possibilities or special features. The performance and ease of use of the web GUI has also improved a lot compared to my previous Asus router, a WL500W. Being able to set most configuration items without a reboot is a godsend.

Another nice touch from Asus was providing a discovery utility, that finds the router on the LAN and detects its current IP address, which saved me a lot of time when I was tweaking the IP configuration of the two routers.

I cannot comment on the 2.4 GHz range or behavior, as I only use the router at 5 GHz.

Update (9/17/2014): I was having print server reliability issues with the stock firmware (after a few days the printer stopped printing, even though the router showed it was connected). So I installed DD-WRT, and I'm back to being a perfectly satisfied customer. Aside from the printer trouble, I only had to reboot the router for firmware updates and I never experienced any connection issues whatsoever.",1

Ok, I do love these types of forbidden reads. I enjoyed reading Sebastian and Paige's story. It was a quick, hot read. However, I did feel like the interaction between Paige and Sebastian was a little stiff at times. Always so formal and it felt a bit forced. I
That being said, I did love the other characters, Ashely and Grant. I want to read their story. They intrigued me. I'm hoping that they do get a story.
Their appearance, along with drama that Caleb brought was what kept me swiping pages. Caleb had me wanting to jump into my kindle to throat punch him.

"My four-year-old daughter loves Disney Junior, and while she'll watch Miles from Tomorrowland, it's never been one of her favorites. As a result, this Photon Flyer was our first Miles toy. My daughter apparently recognized the craft from the show and immediately began to play with it.

Although the Miles figure glows and the wings light up, it's actually pretty basic for a toy vehicle these days.  The wings fold back a little for ""surface mode,"" and the nose of the craft can slightly extend for ""hyper speed mode,"" but that's about it. On the one hand, it opens a door for fun and imagination, but I think my youngest was a bit disappointed that it didn't at least make sounds.

Of course, this Photon Flyer works best when combined with other Miles toys that we do not have. It fits into a sold-separately toy called the Stellosphere, which -- according to the box -- ""amps up"" this toy with sounds, more lights, and larger wings. So at the moment, our vehicle is not ""amped up,"" nor do we have accessories (none included) to store in the ship's cute cargo hold. Although my daughter creatively put some Lion Guard stuff in there and promptly added Lion Guard figures to her Miles missions. And finally, the box prominently shows the Merc figure (not included) who has his own custom seat and moon roof in the flyer.

All in all, if you have other Miles toys already, this Photon Flyer is a great addition to any collection. It works great with other figures, accessories, and the Stellosphere set. If, like us, it's all on its own in the Miles universe, you'll likely be encouraged by your child to expand your collection... Unless they want to enlist other friends, like the Lion Guard, in their space adventures.",1
"UPDATE 7/4/15: I wore three pair of the same pair in two different colors for a couple of hours.

I had to replace the ""gold"" ring with a new one, and now it's a little smaller in the size. The size is perfect, and it's very comfortable.

The bottom of the ring is very small, but the inside is very strong. I will say that if you wear it alone, it won't last long. It's very delicate, and it's very light weight. The color is very vibrant, and it looks quite nice on.

I am very pleased with this purchase, and it's a great product. It's a very good quality product, and I'm happy to say that I'll be ordering more of these again in the future.I love these shoes.

These little lights are the coolest! Our boys (10 and 7) just love them:) They were super easy to install and even came with a zip tie to make sure they don't fall off.

"I only gave this 4 stars because of the installation struggle I had with the post installation. Putting in on the mobo wasn't that bad at all (I had to take it out, but it was fine.) The problem I had (and might have could prevented) was putting the usb connecters and 4-pin connector on the board which were all underneath the fan.

It fits nice in My Lanbox Lite with just enough room between my fan and the PSU. I was originally gettting the Blue Orb II, but on the day my item was suppose to be delivered, I got an email from Amazon stating that the item was out of stock and they had to refund me.

Anyway, the fan looks, sounds, and cools ALOT better that the stock intel fan that I originally had there. I have a Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600. With Stock, temps were 44c idle, as high as mid 60s load. With this, 36 idle, 50 load. I call that improvement considering the noise difference.

Edit: After further use, I used the 2 60mm fans that are placced the the inside to the outside of the vents to suck out the heat that lingers in that area (most likely due to the heat coming off of the cpu and out of the PSU that is DIRECTLY above the CPU fan. The temperature is now around the same temperature as the stock, but MUCH quieter, especially with my fan controller.",1

The poop is easily scooped up with the scooper and I can just flush it which makes the house smell better. I would highly recommend this product!

"I received an ARC of this book in exchange for a honest review.

As American as apple pie! I have been getting into Sports romances here lately ever since I read Pucked By: Helena Hunting, while Rage does not have quite the comedic timing it is still an engrossing read. I love baseball, even grew up playing it myself with my friends so I have a soft spot for anything to do with the sport. AJ is the main character and while he's a bit of a hot head he's an awesome player both on the field and off if you catch my drift ;)

Until he hits the major leagues his temper has controlled his career but after a coach takes him under his wing and along the way he introduces  AJ to his granddaughter who is adorable! And leads to me changing my opinion of AJ, he's great with Clair and eventually meets her mother Addison. . . He makes a stellar first impression let me tell you! Acting like a Grade A . . . Well you know haha but he makes a huge turn around.

I really enjoyed this book, the characters were so well done and the author built up enough intrigue and tension between Addison and AJ that it made for a natural progression. Not like some where they meet and within the first couple of chapters they are falling into bed. I like that she was cautious of beginning a relationship because of Clair it made her a good momma which is one of my favorite character traits of hers. There are some twists and turns in this story that I didn't quite anticipate and that made me want to pick up everything Elizabeth writes from now on. I highly recommend this book for those who enjoy sports romances!",1

I think I'll wear them enough to see if the fabric stretches before I order another pair, though, in case I need a 6-1/2.

The shoes are light as a feather.  We'll see how they hold up, but I plan to wear them everywhere.  They have an insert that reminds me of one I used to buy for high heels.  It has a small arch support that I didn't expect and should make the shoes more comfortable for long periods of walking.

This shirt seems like no exception to that rule but I was a bit surprised to find that the fit is a bit tight. So buyer beware, if you're normally a size large then you may want to scale up one size to an XL.

I tend to dress a bit more casually to work and usually just throw on a sport jacket, shirt and slacks. I rarely go with a tie unless there's a reason to. So for my purposes I think this shirt will work out very nicely. I think 95% of the shirts I own are blue or have blue in them so it'll fit right in with the rest of my wardrobe.

I was also pleased to find that this shirt is lightweight and does not feel like a heavy cotton shirt. That will definitely be appreciated in the hot, muggy Midwest summer.

I would classify this as a modern shirt with a lightweight construction, buttons (instead of french cuff) all around, small collar, slim fit, and less shirt material (tail). Overall I'm quite pleased with the shirt but I'd probably go a size up if ordering another.",1

"Crimson Eve, the 3rd book in Brandilyn Collins' Kanner Lake series, has been in my TBR stack for quite some time.  I read Violet Dawn (nicknamed Violent Dawn by my book club) and Amber Morn quite a while ago, but was not lost when I started this novel.  Really, they could probably be read as stand-alones, but I like to begin at the beginning.  The novel starts out running and really never quits.  Carla Radling is targeted by a hit man and is unsure just why someone wants her dead.  She literally stumbles into safety, but on the run, she can never be sure who to trust.  The story unfolds through present day action and the diary entries from Carla's 16 year old diary.  The switch between the two really works and the reader is not confused thanks to date entries at the top of chapters and a different font for the diary.  Crimson Eve is a good, quick read if you are looking for page turning suspense.",1

"This freebie is so worth it. Is short and cute and meaningful. Tork is a homeless young man. I don't get to know the real reason why he is homeless or the real facts about what he endured while being on the street. But his POV had a poignant feel to it that make my heart ache for this lonely man. Adam is a college kid and a world class jerk. He involuntarily volunteer in the shelter in order to get a good reference for college. His had a super-sized ego, rude, selfish, narcissist and etc. I'm sure his character is suppose to make people hate him, but I just laugh it off as part of the humor of the story. Every week Adam reluctantly went to the shelter passing our food parcel, while internally hating the work. This is where he met Tork, the green hair exotic creature that he was not suppose to be attracted to. Anyway, when Tork try to evade Adam at every turn, Adam who suffered a bruised ego, decided to start 'The Invasion of Tork', which I find it extremely sweet and funny despite his motive. Later, Adam start to realize that Tork is more than just a no-good-doer homeless man. Overall, despite the short length of the story and the lack of character background, I love this book and wish it was longer. Seriously. Such good stuff shouldn't be so short. I appreciate the fact that although the pace seems slow, but there is a lot of heart to the story and it makes me cry a few times. I can't wait to buy the sequel now.

"I have had to honor of receiving this book from the author for an honest review.  With Every Heartbeat was such a sweet story. I immediately fell in love with Annalise and Raphael!
  Annalise ate, sleep, and breathed to dance. Ballet is her life, every since her mother put her in her first pair of ballet slippers, she could not focus on anything else. Her mom had been a dancer, and she was following in her footsteps.
  Going to Rome with the American Ballet Company was an honor. Fighting for prime solo spots, training hard, and focusing on nothing else. Until she walked away from the group on afternoon that is.... Stumbling across a group of street dancers may have changed her life for good.
  One look at Raphael and she knew she was in trouble. There was something about the way he danced, so free, so alive... and those eyes!! Although she knew it was wrong, that she was risking everything, she continued to sneak away to meet him, just to melt in those eyes, in those strong arms.
  Agreeing to dance with Raphael she had to train her body to move differently. Years and years of ballet dancing could not have prepared her to be able to dance with a partner like him. She is falling in love, and she can't stop herself.
  After finding Raphael dancing with his old partner, Annalise is undeniably heartbroken. Not giving him a chance to explain, she runs. Beats herself over and over for being so naive and stupidly denying the training she needs for her once in a lifetime performance.
  The story of Annalise and Raphael is heart gripping. I loved reading how their story played out and how their love for music was engrained in every step they took in life. The book did remind me a lot of a movie I've seen... American girl meets hot young Italian, who sweeps her off her feet! How can you go wrong!? SWOON!

"I bought this in hopes that it would stay lit... after all, it is called ""Windfighter"". I followed the directions exactly. Well, I think they really need to change the name, because it kept blowing out today every time there was a slight breeze. I believe the design is the defect. Even bucket candles stay lit better than this -- the reason being that a bucket candle's wick is much lower. This ""Windfighter"" has a raised wick. And despite the metal top (that keeps falling off when you move or carry it, because it does not screw on or anything), the wind can just blow right through the holes and extinguish the flame. Another issue with this... when it was lit, it was producing some pretty heavy black soot/smoke. YUK! I can still feel it in my lungs! lol  I bought 3 of these, unfortunately, and feel like I wasted money, because I am going back to my old bucket candles that stay lit better and do not make black smoke.",1

This shirt has been the best i've worn so far - it makes me feel cooler more comfortable on the trail runs.
Please note size chart below; the information was provided by Saucony and it seems Runners like to feel larger than they actually are compared to the rest of the population; therefore, saucony's sizes will run smaller than most manufacturers sizes.

The shirt performs very well and the only problem I have is the fit - My chest size is 48 and most XL's fit nicely,, however, this XL might be maxed out to 45 or 46.

"I seems odd to get all excited about a booklight, but this is honestly the best booklight I have ever owned and I have gone through a lot of them, being an insomniac night reader with an early-bedtime husband.

The most excellent feature on this little light is the very high quality metal gooseneck. It will move absolutely any way that you want it to go with ZERO bounceback. In addition to moving effectively right and left and up and down, the head of the light twists equally well and stays put.

The light itself is pleasing with 3 LEDs, and covers the page nicely from mass market paperbacks on up to hard cover releases (I have used it now for both, as well as a trade paperback.)  It is light enough to not bend or damage the book or be falling backwards.  The non-skid pad inside the back of the clip keeps it from sliding around the book or falling sideways as so many of my lights with slip on clips do.

The only caveat that I would mention is that you have to want a light that takes standard batteries.  This takes 3 AAAs, which I love as I can use rechargable batteries.  They are easy to change and don't add to much weight, but does make for a larger housing than some people want in their booklights.  I'll take that any day to having to dig up expensive and sometimes hard to find ""watch"" batteries.  I have yet to need to change the batteries after three large books worth of reading thanks to the LEDs.

The light has a full and dim setting which my husband appreciates when I am reading in bed.

If you are looking for a new booklight (and want one with standard batteries) you have found it.  I can't recommend this highly enough.",1

"There are few flashlights as versital as this. Streamlight makes this device in many vetsions. I prefer the sportsman model as the tactical ones include an infra red led. If you have nvg's you might prefer the tactical versions.

There is one other big difference between the military and sportsman models. The military ones will start at the lowest setting once activated. The sportsman is just the opposite.

The various colored leds serve various rolls. Red keeps up your night vision, great for not disturbing your partner at night when nature cqlls. Green is the color human eyes are mosr sensative to. The blue is a bit of an anigima. Someone with more detailed info should be refrenced here.

This my 'go to' flashlight. I keep one at my bedside and another in the end table next to my easy chair.

It's hard to find anything to complain about this. I reccomend you get one or two. I know they are expensive but if your safety depends on a good flashlight, do you really want a $5 cheap wally world one?",1

"Bought The Satechi SD Mini & the X-Mini Happy from Amazon.

The X-Mini Happy was $28 more (at the time)
and also came with a 2GB SD Card (mini with adapter)
plus Earphones (Plug Type).

Both came with a Pull String Carry Sack.

I loaded 2 SD cards with the same MP3s,
synchronized the start as best as possible,
and compared the sound of each using the respective Mute Buttons.

No Doubt About It: the X-Mini Happy had a Better Sound.

The SD Mini sounded OK until it was being compared to the X-Mini Happy.

The X-Mini Happy seemed to have a Fuller Sound -
Particularly with the Classical Music
(Amazon's: 99 Most Essential Masterpieces of the Classical Era).

But if you don't want to spend the Extra Bucks for the X-Mini Happy,
you won't be Sad with the SD Mini.

Also, the Earphones included with the Happy are OK,
but when compared with the
""Monster Turbine High-Performance In-Ear Speakers"",
they were Sadly, Quite Inferior.
But this might have been an Unfair Comparison.",1

"The even spread of 5 star through 1 star comments here reflect the subjective experience of the viewers more than any film I have seen recently. Now in his eighties, Eastwood directs a film whose theme lies close to heart of all people who have matured as they have aged. It is a reflection on the possibilities of the afterlife that we all think about as we age. Eastwood offers no answers but instead gives us 3 parallel stories of people who have experienced death or near death; a woman drowned in a tsunami, a psychic who sees his ability as an affliction, and a young boy who loses his twin to death. Each protagonist searches for answers, as we all do. Viewers may not be satisfied by that lack of concrete solutions but a film about death and acceptance can have no other ending. Some viewers may be fooled by the opening tsunami sequence into thinking that this is an action film. The absorbingly realistic set of CGI sequences that open the film makes other CGI laden films look artificial and lame. But it  is not an action film though studio marketing may have given people that idea. In lesser hands a film like this would be filled by after death pseudo babble that has been all to common in American cinema over the decades. Entertaining but trivial films such as 'Ghost' are pedestrian but pleasant to watch. TV shows like 'Medium' were light silly but enjoyable time wasters. Eastwood does nothing like that here. Instead this is a film for people who think, those who are at the end of life, and those who have had life threatening experiences. Highly recommended.",1

"For the price, these treat boxes are excellent.  The 6"" tall measurement is from the base to the top of the handles when they are assembled.  In terms of storage space, the interior dimensions once assembled can accommodate items about 6"" long, 3"" wide, and 3-4"" tall.  Like most cheap mass-produced paper goods, there are some small defects on some individual pieces (some cuts aren't clean, some stick together, etc.),  If you are a perfectionist who will be bothered by these slight defects, you should consider ordering a 10% overrun.  Mine were going to kids, so I didn't care.  I would not use these for heavy items, but they were great for kids party favors.",1

My Craftsman seemed to have more power too, mind you this saw has been around for 15yrs and was used pretty hard, I used it for all my junk cutting and I liked it better then the Rigid, so much I went to give it back and the guy and he told me he did not want it back, to throw it in the garbage.

"This review is also posted on my blog: theshortreviewer.blogspot.com

I normally enjoy stories that are told through the viewpoint of someone you can feel for--you know, a good guy or girl. Being that I knew this story would be told through the eyes of someone truly evil, then I got past that and found myself both intrigued and utterly disgusted at the same time. I do like a good disturbing thriller after all. And this book certainly delivered on that.

Fearlessly written, the author holds absolutely nothing back. This is not an exaggeration. The main character is a serial killer, and you are taken into his sick and twisted mind. The repetitiveness of his thoughts is indicative of how I believe someone like him would think. I had no empathy for this character at all. I found myself hoping this was fiction and not an autobiography in disguise! That is how good of a job the author does with bringing you inside this psycho's demented world.

The story is graphic, and many of the scenes are deeply horrifying and troubling. And what is even more terrifying is that there are people out there who do commit atrocious crimes such as this. So even though this is fiction, it is probably more realistic than most of us would like to believe.

It often read more like a diary, where the killer tells a lot of his story, and the dialogue is limited. It was a short, quick read, and I do sincerely hope for a sequel. The story did not feel finished as there is definitely more to be told here.

I recommend this for anyone who thinks they can take it for what it is - a messed up and gritty story.",1
"This book was quite interesting to me. I agree that many people, even Christians can't handle laments. Most of us are silenced and reduced to ""faking fine. "" No one really wants to know anything about the negative. But everyone seems to be a counselor and offers advice that's unwanted and unneeded. I couldn't relate to the author's neverending supply of supportive friends who helped her all along the way with her issues. I found myself wanting to feel more sorry for her lack of relationship with her family, but I had some questions. She left her brother out of her story almost altogether. How did he react to events?

I couldn't relate to the somewhat shallow craving for shopping and closets full of shoes. I don't lament things. I'm not into prosperity gospel. And who gets to go on a long retreat to Alaska to heal? Almost none of us. I think I was hoping for more of a workbook than a personal account. The book touches on a lot of good points about biblical laments in Psalms, Job, Lamentations. Some of the stories became repetitive and I think it could have been condensed a bit. The book is a good commentary of realizing that many of us are not ""just fine.",1

It's a great game and finally after months of me winning every game, my kids have all beaten me at least once (and I do not believe in throwing a game). The board is set up like a map of the United Sates and each person is giving routes that they have to complete. You get points for completing your route, or you lose those points if you don't get them. The concept is relatively easy, but it's a lot of fun!

Usually carriers have a couple double zippers, I'll use a little clip on the main zipper, and the others have to be zip tied. This carrier comes with a zipper on the side that can't really be secured because it's not a double zipper. I had to zip tie it to the handle and my cat was still giving me a run for my money trying to squeeze out. Too late to return it since it's used, but I wouldn't recommend it for cats, especially sneaky ones.",1

I didn't even bother to try opening a bottle after that.

"After the solid third season, Frasier came back with what could arguably be its best season. There were new storylines: Martin meeting a new lady, Sherry (played by Marsha Mason), who doesn't exactly hit it off with the rest of the gang--as well as continuations of old ones: Niles trying to reconcile with Maris. The biggest story of this season, though, was off-camera: star Kelsey Grammer went into rehab, which necessitated that the others in the cast pick up the slack. They proved up to the task, of course, and upon Grammer's return the show became better than ever. In this season, we were visited by familiar faces like Lilith and Frederick for a memorable Thanksgiving episode, as well as Agent Bebe, as well as surprise appearances (James Earl Jones). In addition, this season contained some of the truly greatest episodes of this show: the opener, The Two Mrs. Cranes, had the show's farcical sense of its humor at its most potent, Ham Radio featured delightfully unhinged performances by the supporting cast, and Are You Being Served? features one of the show's funniest moments. This is where the show hit its peak: the synthesis of great acting, writing, and ensemble acting that made this show memorable. If you love Frasier, these episodes are probably many of the reasons why. If you only buy one set of Frasier DVDs, this should probably be it.",1

The ""bad guy"" is just the bad guy, and the ""good guy"" is just the bad guy.  So the writers had to do some soul searching and some soul searching to get the actors to come out and do the show.

"This Swedish comedy is set in 1970 and takes a look at life in a commune in Stockholm. Elisabeth (Lisa Lindgren) runs away from her drunken husband, Rolf (Michael Nyqvist), after he hits her in the face, taking along her 13-year-old daughter and son who is eight or nine. They land up with Elizabeth's brother who lives in a hippie commune where the members are all committed to socialism, vegetarianism, feminism and open-marriage but cannot agree whose turn it is to do the washing up.

The poor kids feel humiliated and estranged among a bunch of immature adults -- and their father's efforts to win back their trust only make things worse. But slowly they begin forming relationships with other kids their own age. Meanwhile Elizabeth is introduced to feminist ideas expressed by the radical notion of allowing her underarm hair to grow. We soon learn that behind the empty slogans of the hippies lies deep hypocrisy -- and we eventually learn what it takes to form a real community bound by ties of love and affection. Along the way there are many funny moments.

What I liked about this movie, apart from the Abba soundtrack, is that the characters change and grow -- and that the ideological points it makes are delivered subtly instead of being hammered home.",1

"My wife is very particular about ""her things"", and when her tea kettle was starting to rust out, she hinted that she would like a new one for her birthday.  So I found this highly reviewed kettle on Amazon and thought it a good deal for many years of service.  When my wife received it for her birthday, she was not completely satisfied, but over the past two months she has ""gotten used to it"".  Here are her complaints:

1. Difficulty getting water into it.
  - with my wife's old kettle, she filled it through the spout.  The spout on this kettle is a bit narrower than her old one, so at first water would spill down the side and get the outside wet.  She also tried to use the filling lid on top, but the lid has tight tolerances (so steam doesn't escape or rattle around), and the handle doesn't move, so there is no clear path to the pot without getting the outside wet.

2. Difficulty eating water out of it.
  - as you can see from the picture, the spout protrudes from the upper quarter of the pot.  This means she has to hold the kettle at an almost 90 degree angle to pour her hot water, and dousing her hand with a good bit of hot steam.  With filling the kettle a bit fuller than she is used to, we are able to get around that problem.

Now that she's had two months of kettle ownership, she is much better at aiming water into the kettle, and doesn't have so many problems.  She has also noticed that with the flatter and wider bottom of the new kettle, it does heat faster, and it is easier to clean with the nice enameled finish.  However, I think next time that we need a new kettle, I'm just going to install a hot water dispenser at the sink.",1

"Critics are generally not very nice to movies like this one.  I guess THEY didn't grow up watching this kind of stuff and don't  have those fond memories (which explains the 4 stars).  The night me and my family got cable tv in the early 80s (first ones in the neighborhood) this hilarious flick was on.  Nudity on the boob tube was still something new to us.  So Zapped! was just about the coolest naughty movie I'd ever seen.  Watching it now is still a delight!  Just silly non-sense...but awfully fun!  The young lady from The Facts of Life tv show is great (and looks like my niece).  Baio may be a little TOO nerdy, but he and Aames are believable friends.  Plus, anything with Scatman Crothers (The Shining, One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest, Twilight Zone: The Movie) is worth seeing.  This could be the 1982 equivalent of movies like American Pie.  Just leave your brain at the door, pop this in the machine and you'll find much to enjoy on a lazy saturday afternoon.  Try a triple feature with Sixteen Candles and Just One of The Guys (or Weird Science and The Breakfast Club).

"I've been reading Sir Terry Pratchett's books for a long time, and I'm pretty sure that I have had a similar experience.  The basic premise of the story is that a young man is kidnapped by a group of young women who are going to kill him.  The young woman is a fourteen-year-old girl, and the group of women is so obsessed with killing her that they have to take her away from her.  They all have plans to kill her, and they all get together.  The story starts out fairly straightforward, with a young woman in a wheelchair being abducted and killed.  She doesn't have a lot of tools, but she is a fairly skilled fighter and she does a good job of keeping herself safe.  She's also a very clever, intelligent woman, and the group of women are quite good at making sure that the children are safe, too.  I really liked that the group of women were mostly young people, but they also had a lot of good qualities, such as being very intelligent and strong, so they would be very able to handle situations, and they were a bit stubborn about it.

As far as comfort goes, my stock seat is better than this one (specialized comfort seat). Maybe the other reviewers weighed less than I do. I weigh 200 lbs and found this seat to be very hard, stiff and it became very hot in just 15 minutes of riding. it did not protect the sensitive area of my body (men know this area) and it began to hurt very quickly. I would NOT recommend this seat to anyone who weighs more than 175lbs. I returned this seat and purchased a Cloud 9 instead, which is far superior seat. I hope this review helps someone that is really looking for a comfort seat.",1
"The very first time I put my dog's food in this dish he ate a couple bites then grabbed the bottom edge of the bowl and flipped it over to eat the food off the floor. Then (because it did not occur to me to put the bowl on a high shelf) he very quickly chewed all the rubbery non-skid stuff off the bottom of the bowl. He is not really a problem chewer so I think something about this bowl is just too appealing for dogs to resist eating the whole thing. I was just stupid to consider a plastic bowl as safe for a dog, but the pet company who made it is absolutely irresponsible.",1
"The usual problem with reviewing cat toys is what to say when kitty doesn't like / use the toy. It's hard to evaluate a product made for cats as a human, so normally if I get a toy and Ms Cat does not like it, I say no harm, no foul and usually opine that someone else's cat may like the toy / furniture.

Not the case here. The entire premise of this toy is flawed, and I really don't think many cat owners or their pets will have much use for it.

First, the cat shown in the picture lounging on the arch of the X must have been a) very much smaller than normal cats and b) carefully trained. My own quadruped is very average sized and she could not at all lounge on this thing without drooping more than a third of her body off of it. Most cats will not willingly assume such a position, so don't think of this as furniture.

As a scratching post (and also as a theoretical lounging platform) this is also flawed, as it is very light weight and cheaply made. Cats will not use scratching posts that move around as they try to dig in, and this design is too light weight to offer the stability that a cat seeking to scratch is looking for.

My cat tried this once as a scratching post, after I poured catnip over it, and after it slid across the floor as she tried to stretch out, she turned her nose up at it and has not returned to it since.

Folks, if you want a scratching post, make sure it is solid and heavy. It will cost more than this does. If you want cat furniture, make sure it is solid and large enough to accommodate your cat. The designers of this product ignored these axioms and used a trained miniature cat to make it look more useful than it is.

Two stars, because your cat might like it as a scratching post if you can wedge it somewhere where it can't move around too easily.",1

"I've had my eye on this series ever since I got to read a snippet of the forthcoming first book in the series, Caged Warrior, due out in June of this year, and so I snapped up this novella as soon as I had the chance.

Dark and unapologetically gritty, this story was full of pulse-pounding action, and earthy heat that keeps you begging for more.

I loved that the heroine was a true warrior -- she isn't one of those supposedly ""strong"" heroines who suddenly turns weak and dependent on a hero halfway through the story. Instead, she lives up to her reputation as a fearsome warrior, and gives our hero, Hark, a real run for his money.

While I'm never one for a whirl-wind romance, and I didn't care for the fact that the ending was more of a Happy For Now than a Happily Ever After, there was no denying that the courtship between these two, and the ending of the story simply fit with these two characters and the world that they lived in.

There was also one of, if not the most romantic scenes ever, despite the blood and brutality involved.

A very solid 4/5 Stars.

"I had originally posted a pretty scathing review because of my dissatisfaction with this product. Kooltek promptly contacted me both by replaying here and by e-mail, and offered me a full refund and said that I could keep the cooler. I promised that if I kept it, I would try the product again on another computer I have that is an exact duplicate of the one I first installed it on.

I just got time to do that this weekend, so here is my revised review.

Pros - Cooler installs fairly easily with no modifications to the motherboard. Fan has a cool blue LED.

Cons - Performance is mediocre. I'm not sure it cools any better than my stock cooler, but it does so quieter since it uses a 120 mm fan running at less than half the speed of the small fan on the stock cooler.

I'm using this on an ASUS motherboard with an AM3+ socket. Unlike some coolers, I didn't have to chance the mount and backing plate to install this one. But the mount is cumbersome, requiring you to get fingers down into spots that can be tight to push down on the spring clips.

I wonder if the heat sink compound that came with the cooler is of good quality? I had terrible results with the first installation when I used it, but on the second installation I used some compound that I had purchased awhile back. It seems of better quality.

It does seem to be performing better than the first time, but not as well as I would have hoped. Another cooler I paid only $10 more for dramatically outperforms this one, though it is much harder to install, requiring removing and replacing the mount and backing plate.

I think this cooler needs further refinement to be a viable product. For now, I recommend paying $10 ore and going with a better product.

But kudos to Kooltek for standing behind their product and going the extra mile to make me happy. That went a long way with me.",1

The kids were excited about it, but it was a bit difficult to use and needed more help from the adults. A couple of the things that I found to be disappointing was that the directions were hard to follow. It seems like you have to follow a different set of instructions than what you have to follow. My son is almost 3 and he doesn't know how to operate the motor yet. I would have liked to have gotten a better instructions, but I just don't see how that would have helped.

They are good workout headphones however

However, ours haven't mildewed yet, so fingers crossed.",1
"Because the author gave me a copy of her book to review, Amazon will not say verified purchase. I started off reading this novel kind of slow, as I myself am also an author. I found this book from the fourth page on to be written with charm. On every page, there is a twist and turn that seems like it would really happen in real life. One of my favorite parts of the novel is at the beginning when the protagonist met a stand in for the new contractor. He called the protagonists' house a haunted house. I could relate to growing up with houses that I thought were haunted and I remember going in them and running out because I was so scared. Eventually, everyone has to face something that they are not willing to. It'sa good read and I think anyone reading it will enjoy it.",1

I love this so much I bought one for myself. I love the fact that it is so easy to carry and carry. I have had it for a few weeks now and it works great.

Brainy lab scientist Laura Manning has got a two big problems 1) she has to present the findings of her lastest project to the broard in a little over one week and 2) that would be easier if she didn't have sexier-than-sin Jay Cutler as her lab partner, all added to the fact that someone is out to get their secret files on the project by any means. So exactly how are they going to test their 'pleasure control' drug without anyone finding out their results before they present them to the board? -on themselves of course! Laura thinks that this is all in the name of science, but Jay has other ideas and after the 'experiments' are over, he's thinking of a more permanent relationship. But, ""Wildman"" Jay Cutler has really got his work cut out for him because Laura has a hard time believing it's her that he wants and not because he was under the influence of the pleasure drugs.

This is a really good debut. A very hot book. If your looking for lots of  scorching hot love scenes in a contemporary then this one is for you.  But my biggest gripe is the length, which is a little over 200 hundred pages with large type. I think the author could have added another 100 pages easily (perhaps it's the fault of the editors?). It was just over too fast for me and the overall scenes could have been more descriptive. I did enjoy it though and I'll definitely be getting the sequel. There's lots of room for improvement, but I think that Fox has a good start.

A very good short and heavy-on-the-love-scenes contemporary read.",1

Of all the very excellent believable performances I have to single out Lucy Liu as O-Ren Ishi a part that Ms. Liu has captured to the fullest.  Part viscous, aloof, funny, autocratic, determined, cruel and viperous I only wish we could see more of this ""empress of the Yakuza"" as a future film series as she has really captured the essence of this woman, this assassin, this powerhouse.  In addition Uma Thurman is the glue that holds this film together, and what a job she does of it.  I can hardly wait for Volume 2 to come out in February.

I know that keeping this extra around the middle can be dangerous to my health, so I needed to do something fast. I picked up this ebook because it seemed straight forward, and I am glad I got it!

""Losing Belly Fat"" really helped jump start my game again by helping me cover all my bases. The books talks about what types of fat their are, what kind of foods pack on the fat, and how to demolish that fat. I am grateful for the belly busting exercises included so I can really talk with a trainer about working on my core. Also included are a 5 day diet plan and diet pills that can actually help lose loose those pounds.

It's excellent on fruits with a natural wax or tough rind like orange because of the ridging helps keep the item you're slicing on the knife. I've had an orange slip while I was trying to cut it with a smooth blade, not fun. My only qualm is that for some reason this knife's sheath is not like the rest the sheath has a little part that allows it to stand which keeps it from fitting into the drawers with the other knives because it is a bit bulky.

The twists and turns and revelations got the better of me, I finished the book the second day.  I love how Sookie is a pawn and yet, so much more self-possessed and in control in this novel than previous ones.

She is one very sexy lady. This feels like a cool indie thriller movie--quirky, very personal and idiosyncratic, but wholly believable. The scene on the boat near the end just had me jumping out of my chair. Not expecting THAT one, I can tell you! Very happy I found this one.",1

This Schrade knife is too big for everyday carry for work on the property.  Best to strap this to your bag or in the truck.  It becomes a chore lugging it around.  But for what it is and at its price point, you can't beat it for an entry-level quality steel workhorse knife that you can beat up.  The handle becomes too abrasive for bare hands but with gloves, no problem.  The nylon sheath is nothing to write home about but it fits the provided sharpener and fire steel just right.  But in its sheath, the knife looks too ""clunky.""  The top button snaps do not lock easy.  I'm impressed with the knife.",1

This is a classic movie, with great story, great cast, and wonderful scenery. The ending was a little disappointing, but it was just what I expected. I am not sure if I will watch the movie again, but it is worth seeing. If you like classic movies, this is a great movie. You will be enjoying it. This is one of those movies you can watch over and over again. I would recommend this movie to any movie lover. Great movie for a good price.",0
"Having lived in a cave for the last decade or so, I confess I had no knowledge of Jeremy Wade and his ""River Monsters"" television show. Glancing at the 'New Books' section of my local library, I spotted RIVER MONSTERS..and I was hooked. I'm glad I happened to spot Wade's book; it's a fascinating and informative guide to freshwater beasties few people even knew existed.

For the past 20-odd years, Wade, a Brit zoologist with a touch of Indiana Jones thrown in, has been traipsing the globe, searching for legendary freshwater fish. In RIVER MONSTERS, he shares the results of his quest and the results are eye-openers. Wade's descriptions of his efforts to find, fish for and land goliath tigerfish, arapaima, goonch, ripsaw catfish and longfin eels are wonderfully exciting, excitement only topped by the wonder of seeing actual photographs of those - often humungous - creatures. Along the way, Wade imparts valuable information on his finny friends and how they, in some cases, acquired fearsome if undeserved reputations as man-killers.

Yet, exciting as Wade's adventures are, there is a cautionary note running throughout the book. Overfishing is taking its toll of fishlife, large and small, worldwide and Wade points out the fact that many of the freshwater beasties he tangled with are threatened with extinction.

In short, RIVER MONSTERS is an appealing, exciting and insightful guide to aquatic wonders that - may still - lurk in freshwater rivers. Recommended.",1

"This was an impulse lightning deal buy. I own a few ceramic blade knives. A couple of folders and a chefs knife. Those are decent tools. Sharp enough to shave hair. This box cutter wouldn't be so bad if it had any kind of edge on it. I'm not talking shaving here I just mean an EDGE! I have sharper butter knives. It still cuts through packing tape but going through cardboard ain't so easy. This thing has an auto retracting blade. It requires constant tension with your thumb to hold the blade out while trying to hold onto the cutter. This in combination with the dull blade makes cutting though tougher materials harder than it needs to be. If they had just sharpened it a little bit more it would work so much better. The magnet is a nice touch and makes it more accessible. Still, I'll stick with my metal blade box cutter and just be careful. Another thing to keep in mind, ceramic blades are harder than metal blades but that means they are more brittle too. Put too much sideways pressure on this blade and it will break like a clay pot .It can't be returned! No Dilly! UPDATE: I was too harsh with my review of this little dude. After using it more I've change my mind about one thing. It does exactly what it is designed to do. Open packages and boxes. All of my earlier criticisms were warranted. It sucks at cutting up cardboard. The retractable blade while being a valid saftey feature is still a pain. Maybe it will wear in after more use. The cerramic blade could be sharper but it suffices for cutting packing tape and soft packaging. But I am also glad it was unreturnable. This forced me to use it more and see it's value. It gets another star for effectiveness. I'm still glad I didn't pay full price for it.",1

"I have purchased six different brands, and models of 24 cup mini muffin pans.  I can't begin to tell you how many differences there are from pan to pan.

The reason I prefer this pan over others is that I bake mini brownies, cupcakes, carrot cakes and 'mini bite"" pastries of all kinds.  I use the fluted paper baking cups that measure 1-1/2"" X 1""
deep.  I use Reynolds brand, FC150x350 paper baking cups. the box says 3-1/2"" fluted cups, but that's the measurement before the cups are formed at the factory. *** Since the cups of this pan are only 3/4"" deep it allows the cakes and brownies to slightly ""flair out"" at the top; making them look larger than the ones made in deeper pans with the same 2"" diameter at the top.

I baked the identical pastries (half made in this pan, and others that were baked in the pans that were !"" deep). I offered them on trays set side by side, telling customers that they were ""IDENTICAL IN WEIGHT AND VOLUME"". Not one customer chose the pastries that were baked in the deeper pans. When you look at the finished product; made in this pan, it ""LOOKS"" and IS larger at the top!

I LOVE this pan, above any of the others and ""HIGHLY RECOMMEND"" it! The non-stick surface is outstanding too.

The Commercial II non-stick 24 cup mini- muffin pan measures 15-3/4"" by II""; each muffin measures 2"" in diameter and 3/4"" deep.

The wire is very flexible and should work fine.  I marked it down because the red and black wires are completely separate from each other and this was not made clear in the description.

I would say these are an OK value for the price.  They are attractive though I wish the contrast were a bit more.
The Wallace pieces are heavier and have 18-10 stainlesss, meaning they have 8%-10%  nickel which gives them shine and means they are less likely to rust.

"When Cass Stone and Logan Alexander meet, it's not love at first sight. Both pretending to be someone that they're not, neither Cass nor Logan was looking for more than a fun night, with no strings, then they'd go their separate ways. Funny how things never go as planned.

Fast forward two years. Cass is an independent successful woman, striving to be taken seriously in a field dominated by men. Life has not turned out exactly as she'd expected, but she is smart and secure enough in herself and her goals to roll with the changes that life has thrown her way. Finding herself a single mom, she has more than risen to the occasion, and is raising Olivia with the love that she never experienced in her own childhood.

While Logan has spent the last two years dedicated to his job, he hasn't ever forgotten that night with Cass. When the two meet again, it's like the sexual tension has been simmering under the surface, and like they haven't been apart at all. Finding out that Cass (or Miss Mary, as he calls her; seriously sexy!) and he have a daughter rocks his world. Even though he is angry that she's kept Olivia from him (or so he thinks), he can't fight the attraction for Cass that's still as strong as ever.

I thoroughly enjoyed this book. There is humor, intrigue (it's a spy story, after all!), passion, and so much love. The characters are well-developed and likeable, the kind of people that you absolutely want to hang out with. Paula Altenburg has written a book that drew me in and kept me reading, and I look forward to reading more from her.",1

It felt like a potboiler Grisham dashed off to justify the expense of an Italian vacation or to make use of some scrap notes he'd made while working on a larger project.

The book's characters are quite 2-D. Ex-NFL quarterback Rick Dockery does undergo a small amount of personal growth in his acceptance of his situation in Italy but that's a pretty minor transformation against a backdrop of predictable stereotypical supporting cast members.

The plot is all but non-existent. It's really a slice of life rather than a true narrative. It has a beginning and a middle but no end. Not only is the story line unfinished (that's not a crime, but in this case it's piled on top of the other issues the book presents and adds to the sense of incompletion), it's not clear it would have been interesting had Grisham bothered to bring it to a conclusion.

Overall, it's not only that I expect more of Grisham, it's that I expect more from any good book. This book just doesn't rank as one I'd recommend to anyone.",1
"I've had these for a while. On the good side, they stay exactly where I want them, the padding is solid and in the right places, and doesn't ride straight up into my crack. The bad side, they don't breath at all. They make me sweat worse. And the elastic around my legs leaves marks it's so strong.

"Took my 10 year old daughter to see Frozen last night...
We were both very excited to see the movie based on the previews we had seen & our love for animated movies...

This movie will NOT disappoint you! It was an absolute GEM of a movie!!!
Although we saw it in 2d, it was visually STIMULATING, with STUNNING effects, action sequences & characters!!!
All the characters, scenery, and animation were Simply AMAZING!!!
Not too mention the voices of all the characters were a perfect fit & each voice over was clear and accurately defined!

Now for the story...
It was a well written story with built in Humor, loyalty, friendship and love!
A story that kids of all ages & adults could follow & believe in!

There is something in this movie for Everyone that watches it:)

If you have children, take them to see this movie ASAP... it is the perfect time of year, and will add to the Holiday Spirit...
If your child, ask your Parent or Parents to take you to this movie...
If your an adult, go see this movie... it will most likely bring back fond memories and you will leave the theater fulfilled!!!

I give this movie an A+

"Sending a shout out to the author-Julie Bailes.  Thank you for the gift of your book.  I told you I'd review and here I am.  Just got done with this book.  What a rollercoaster ride of emotions?!  Ali, the lead female, has endured heartbreaking loss multiple times and yet she endures.  Blake has been her devoted ally for years and is determined to help her heal.  While I enjoyed the book, it seemed a bit hard for me to get into.  I realize all the reasons for how the book is laid out considering the ending... but it seemed to be drawn out and sometimes slow. The ending was a cliff hanger and ended rather unexpectedly.  Still Ms. Bailes is a fine author.  Her story flows, there are no spelling or grammar errors which makes the story easy to follow.  It seemed to take awhile to really get to the heart of the book but once I did, I found myself eagerly following along, cheering for Ali and Blake.  Give Shattered and Shaken a chance.

I have to confess I bought this book for my 4 yr. old daughter and ended up keeping it for myself! It's still in the family so I think it's okay--besides I think she's a bit young for it! I bought it because I thought it would be inspirational for my young daughter and as I started reading through it I found it inspiring myself. I love the way the artist's talk about their experiences with art. I also enjoyed looking at the art they created when they were young. Many of the artists also give bits of inspiring words for the young artists to think about. I think this book would be a wonderful gift for a young inspiring artist or anyone who enjoys art!,1

This years favorite book. I really wanted to understand life in Kentucky and the exodus to the midwest and the problems in the area after coal left so many people without jobs.

"One of those increasingly rare ""wow, this is way better than I thought it'd be"" purchases. Barn doors are trendy and seem like a thrifty way to salvage a used door but then you go to buy the hardware and you're hit with a $300+ price tag. So, a $75 option seemed a little suspicious. But I trusted the reviews, and went for it and I'm thrilled with it.

The good:

 - The hardware is hefty and feels 'well machined'
 - it looks good. Not overly stylized so would fit in well in most rooms.
 - installed fairly easily.
 - Came with a matching door 'handle' (which while noted, was something I didn't realize initially)

The minor nit-picks

 - The roller hardware that mounts to the door isn't adjustable in or out. As such, the rollers will hang over the edge of the door a bit so the door isn't balanced on its center of gravity. Maybe this is intentional, but felt a bit off to me.
 - The instructions could have a bit more detail to them.
 - if you are installing this for a bath, note that you will have a gap between the door and frame (see below).

But, again, for $75, those are certainly nit-picks.

As for the bathroom issue, I don't think barn doors are really designed for bathrooms. In my case, I took off the top casing around the door frame and replace it with one that was twice as long. I then mounted the rail hardware to the casing (through into the wall studs, of course). After mounting the rollers and hanging, you are left with about a 5/8th of an inch gap between the door face and the casing. This can feel a bit awkward in a bathroom. I think the fix will be for me to just get clever with the door trim and fir the gap out a bit with some corner bead or the like.",1

"Do I really need to go back and watch the entire movie?  Well, I don't.  If you want to watch a movie that is worth watching, you won't be disappointed.

The movie starts off fairly simple:  the protagonist, who has been given a job by a woman who is a failed singer, is recruited to work with a female singer who is a successful musician who has been given a job by a man who is an alcoholic.  The woman is shown to be a young woman who is trying to get a job and she is not able to find a job.  As the story goes, the woman has a dream.  It is a dream that she has and she does not understand.  When she sees the dream she realizes she is a failed singer and she is not the only singer in the world who is a failure.  This is what she wants and the dream is the only thing that she can do to get a job.  She has a lot of good qualities, but her dreams are not true.  The movie is very well done, with some very good performances by the women and some very bad ones.  The story is very well told and the acting is good.  The movie is also a good movie and the movie is a good one.  The ending is a little long, but you will enjoy it.  It is a very good movie.  The movie is very good and the movie is a good one.

"I'm a photojournalist and bought this monitor after my old 21"" CRT died. I've been very pleased with the HP W2408H over the last couple of weeks, but it does need calibration. If you are a gamer or general user, you will love the brilliant picture straight out of the box. For photographers and editors, the colors are too bright and saturated, too ""juicy"" for critical use.

I uninstalled the monitor's software, dragged out my venerable $100 Pantone ColorVision ColorPlus (the consumer colorimeter sensor for monitors) and it gave me a nice, clean image in minutes. A worthwhile investment for anyone.

The monitor's wide-screen real estate makes editing hundreds of photos quite a bit easier than with the old square CRT. It also uses less power and produces less heat than a CRT, a nice plus these days. The image is smooth, even and neutral with calibration. Like any LCD, though, you do need to view the screen ""on axis.""

Just to verify what others have said, the built-in speakers are total garbage: weak, tinny, and pointed out the rear so you cannot hear what little sound they do produce. You definitely need external speakers.

With the exception of the crummy speakers and the iffy calibration software, the monitor is excellent. Five stars.",1
"Its easy to put together. No more hard water, flouride, etc. Im using one filter at the moment. I do not plan on using it in river waters, lakes, etc. since the filters are $89-$99 a pop, unless I have to.  The filters are ten dollars cheaper at Infowars. I will use it in a camping situation. If I should have to use it in a emergency situation and filter outside waters in it, Ill update.

The instructions say to flush the system out twice before using, in which I did. It takes awhile for the water to pass through the filter.

The water is silky almost like drinking distilled water.  There no smells or odd tastes. I drink a lot of water & its nice to drink from a stainless steel tank rather than a plastic Brita or plastic jug, even if it claims to be BPH free.

Instead of using my refrigerators ice cubes, I make my own from the AlexaPure Pro. The ice cubes are clearer and theres no more particles floating in my drinks after the ice melts.

I shouldve bought this a few years ago.

After a few months I took it apart & rinsed it out. A few weeks ago I looked at it & red rust looking marks occurred at the bottom of the top tank which sits in the bottom tank. They were set into 4-5 scratch lines and I though it was rust & I didn't want to use any abrasive on it to make sure. At 1st I thought this thing isn't made of stainless.

"I work in the wedding industry and have to work long days, on my feet, outside in the heat, and have to look professional. I've spent a ridiculous amount of money on high end dress shoes like Merrels and just have not been able to find a pair that are comfortable to wear all day. Both for my feet and my back. Enter the Sanuk yoga sling!!! These shoes are amazingly comfortable. Though, I will admit it took a few wears to get used to the feel of the yoga matte bottom. At first, it felt a little ""sticky"" to me, and the fabric part that goes through the toe area was a little thick and took some getting used to. I wore them for a few days before taking them out on a job and I can't get over how comfortable they are. Ii have been wearing these shoes now for 3 months, every work day and I am THRILLED. No more back pain, no more sore feet. I also wear these sometimes during my off time,mans every time I wear them, I get compliments on how cute and comfortable they look. The great thing about these shoes is the yoga matte bottom. It helps your feet grip to the shoe a bit, so your foot can just walk normally, without having to grip the shoe. You may not realize it, but with a lot of Sandals, your foot is having to work to keep the shoe on, changing the way you walk and stand and ultimately causing foot and back pain. Not with these! Also, the soft linen sits comfortably on your skin and breathes nicely in the heat. The only downside is the funky tan lines, which is why I am sure to alternate shoes on my days off, especially if I plan to be outside for most of the day. If it were not for that, I think these might be the only shoes I'd wear all summer. If you are looking for a reasonable priced, comfortable shoe that you can wear and walk in all day.",1

She amazes a lot of people & they always ask where she learns these things. We feel she enjoys herself learning from her ""friends"" on T.V. She also has their books.  I have a DVD player in my car & I have a selection of these shows on separate DVDs which she loves. Now she can see them all on 1 DVD (we use the DVD player in town & it's not always convenient to change a DVD when driving).

The small one is a little bigger than the medium one, but it is perfect for me.  I am very happy with this purchase.I have a 15 pound Yorkie mix.

"I put in a 200-a Square D ""QO"" panelboard when it was time to upgrade, and figured why not put this surgebreaker in at the time, I had slots open and it seemed like a good idea since the house is in rural countryside and has flakey power.
A couple years after- the tree in the front yard about 6' from the house took a direct lightning strike.
It fried our Invisible Fence controller (The wire ground loop carried the strike to the transmitter portion of the controller which was in an outbuilding) and it fried the modem in our DirecTV TiVO receiver (through the phone line which ran underground right by the Invisible Fence wires).
Nothing plugged into the AC was damaged, including three computers and other electronics in the room right by the lightning struck tree.
I can't complain about the two items that were damaged, it wasn't the fault of the Surge Breaker they were damaged. If you can use a screwdriver you can install this if you have two full-width slots available side by side in your breaker panel, but those slots are now eliminated from having breakers. The Siemens surge breakers combine the surge arrestor unit with a pair of breakers, which seems like a better idea to me especially if you have a crowded panel.",1

However, what I find rather inexcusable is that the towel bar does not come with wall anchors for the screws.  Given how little wall anchors cost, there was no reason to not include some with the packaging.  The screws were loose and the bar was in constant danger of falling down (and in fact did fall down a few times) until I went down to the local store and got some wall anchors for #8 screws for less that $1.50 for 4 anchors.  With the drywall anchors that I bought separately, the towel bar is a lot more secure now.",1

"Meh....

If you have nothing to do some afternoon, or are on a flight from NYC to Chicago with a Philly layover, you could do worse. I suppose.  I will give Heller the latitude to play with grammar, punctuation, and sentence structure in the narration, until it becomes clear the narrator is an English major with literary pretensions doing a self-conscious and bad Hemingway imitation. That part is just painful.

Ok, most of this novel has a brisk plot, so WTH not play along? Well because by the end of the afternoon, or flight, you might find you have just spent 4 hours sitting in a kid's basement swapping fever dreams about what you would each do if there was this awesome, crazy really gross disease that like totally destroys the world but it really doesn't but you know it almost does and it still might, you know? but you had like wicked cool weapons AND A PLANE!!!!

"Unfolding like a thriller, Winged Obsession recounts the dogged efforts of U.S. Fish and Game agent Ed Newcomer to lasso his man, Yoshi Kojiyama, a Japanese butterfly smuggler who fancies himself the ""Indiana Jones of butterfly smuggling.""  You could not make up a character like Yoshi.  His personality is truly unique and could only exist in real life.  A fictional person such as he would be laughed off the page.
This book is so rich, filled with so many fascinating elements, and from the very beginning, the reader knows he will not be able to put it down.  Jessica Speart is an unusual combination of nature enthusiast  expert and mystery writer, which makes the varying elements of her story hang together so well.  The reader not only gets much information about butterflies and beetles, and the  black market world behind their collection, but also a ripping good story about a heroic agent who won't stop until he gets his man, no matter what it takes.  Included  is a description of his case against pigeon breeders that is totally apart from the central narrative and could support an entire book on its own.  This is also an entire treatise on the nature of obsession and the need to own the rare, the exotic, the item on the verge of extinction.  ""The rarer the more unusual, the fewer, and the weirder something is, the more it's in demand by people in the trade.""  There will be understandable comparisons to The Orchid Thief, but Winged Obsession is better written, more accessible, funnier and scarier than that one.",1

"Beware if you are a parent of a younger child.  Not sure exactly who this is geared for?  Maybe older kids and adults very into dark steampunk-style?
We knew we were in trouble when one of the first scenes the mid-wife going to deliver Jack offered the mother whiskey?  This was originally a French movie that is dubbed in English and it is weird.  There are a lot of violent and bizarre scenes.  Very mild spoilers for examples: the midwife rips Jack's frozen heart out and replaces it with a cuckoo-clock?  Lots of bullying, including stabbing in the eye.  The songs are bizarre and very mature about intense love (Jack is not supposed to fall in love as one of his three rules to protect his cuckoo clock hearteveryone knows cuckoo clocks can't fall in love without breaking!  What?).  Again, steampunk fans who are teen and up may enjoy this.

I bought these boots for my girlfriend and she was very excited to receive such a lovely gift. She loves that they go on so easily and yet they are incredibly secure once they are laced up. They come in a variety of colors but the blue color we chose is a lovely pairing with any type of denim. They are made fairly well and have held up great so far in their use. The pocket on the boots is great too since it provides a place to stash money or a small set of keys when you don't want to or can't put them elsewhere. She states that they are quite comfortable but despite this she still chose to put a set of cushioning insoles in them. She does this with all of her shoes and boots though. She had worn them for the better part of eight hours and was happy with how great her feet felt despite being active for so long. My girlfriend certainly didn't need another set of boots but these ones are worth having. I think they look great on her and she is quite happy with how they look and feel on herself as well.  I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and fair review of the item and I have found myself to be very happy with my purchase.,1

"Love this!  Let me share the best two recipes ive found to make, the first one makes a 2 lbs loaf and the whole wheat a 1.5 one.
French bread:1 1/3 cups Water; warm
1 1/2 tbsps olive oil
1 1/2 tsp. Salt
2 tbsps Sugar
4 cups bread flour
2 1/4 tsp. Yeast
Original recipe makes 14

servingsResize
Preparation

Place the warm water into your bread pan. Be sure the kneading paddle is in place. Then add the olive oil, the salt, and the sugar, in this order. Add the flour, covering the liguid. Make a small indentation on top of the center of the flour, but not deep enough to reach the liquid. Add the yeast to this indentation. (Adding the ingredients in this order is important, especially when using the timer. It keeps the yeast away from the liquid ingredients until it is time to knead them together. Liquid ingredients will prematurely activate the yeast.) Now you are ready to set your bread pan in the machine and set the timer or choose the French Bread Cycle. This recipe makes a 2lb loaf.

Whole WheatFor 1 1/2 lb. bread machine
1 1/4 cups water
2 tablespoons (7/8 ounce) olive or vegetable oil
1/4 cup honey or maple syrup
3 1/2 cups (14 ounces) King Arthur 100% White Whole Wheat or Traditional Whole Wheat Flour
1/4 cup sunflower, sesame or flax seeds, or a combination (optional)
1 tablespoon vital wheat gluten
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast

Put all of the ingredients into the bread pan in the order listed. Program for basic white bread, and press Start.

both these use oil which i find much easier that cutting up butter and no dry milk or molasses needed or other ingredients I might not have on hand needed.",1

"Private Investigator V.I. Warshawski receives a call from her old high school basketball coach, Mary Ann McFarlane who has been sidelined with cancer. She wants V.I. to help her coach 4 hours a week. V.I. takes on the job and is drawn into the lives of her players.

Josie Dorrado's mother Rose begs her for help as the factory where she works has been sabotaged. Frank Zamar, the factory owner, is angry with V.I., and refuses her help as he is obviously terrified of something.

V.I.'s private life is also in turmoil. The man in her life, Morrell, an investigative reporter, is at home recovering from a serious gunshot wound; and Marcena Love, an attractive and gutsy colleague, is staying with him. Marcena is trying to come up with a story on South Chicago and uses V.I.'s work with the basketball team as a way to get to know people. She ends up getting very close to the player's fathers.

The team needs a real coach, a new gym floor and equipment, so V.I. begins to search for corporate sponsors. She meets the grandson of the famous Bill Bysen, the head of a large conservative huge department store chain called By-Smart. Unlike his family, Billy is an idealist that can see how his family's business practices are harming the neighborhood. Billy brings the pastor of the South Chicago church where he is working to preach at the company headquarter's morning prayer meeting. This really antagonizes the family when the preacher lectures them on their responsibility to the poor and the community.

"This little portable router worked perfectly, with the setup minimal.  Only thing missing was a case or pouch to carry it.

I went to Las Vegas recently with my Nexus 7 tablet, which does not have a wired ethernet port.  I also assumed that some of the hotels in Vegas still had wired internet connections in their rooms.  My stay was at the Monte Carlo, which only has the wired connection in the room.  So I plugged cable into this router in the Access Point mode, which in turn sends out wi-fi signals that my Nexus7 picked up.  A couple of tabs on the Nexus7 to accept the hotels terms, etc. and I had internet access.  I was able to check my emails, etc. in my room.  Since the hotel charges you a daily fee which includes Internet access, might as well put it to good use.

So this TP-Link router worked as advertised.  Plug in the required cables, setup was almost automatic, and instant wi-fi connection to the Internet.  The price was great too.",1

I placed my container on the center of the scale and zeroed it out. I measured out 40 grams of coffee. The container shifted maybe 1/2 inch and BOOM!, there were now 43 grams of coffee. I dumped all the coffee back into its bag to start over. Now, my container, which should be back at zero, weighed 17 grams. So I zeroed it out and tried again to measure out 40 grams of coffee - still a moving target, but I just went with it. I needed coffee. NOW. OK - on to measuring out 80 grams of water for the ""bloom"": I zeroed out my kettle and over-poured by about 10 grams, so I dumped out what I thought would be 10 grams of water. BOOM! there were now 12 grams MORE than what I started with. I poured water out and the weight went up! We live in a wacky world - Floods, famine, fire, and stupid Ozeri Kitchen Scales.",1

"I bought two of these rash guards to take on a trip to Playa Del Carmen, Mexico. I bought one in XL and the other in XXL. The XL fit perfectly, but not like a baggy XL t-shirt would. It fits me more like a Large t-shirt would. But that's they way it's supposed to be. I'm a little out of shape these days so I wanted to get the next size up so I'd have two for two different activities. The XL I used for snorkeling and scuba diving because I didn't want the shirt to be to loose while doing those activities. The XXL, which fit more like an XL t-shirt, I used for hanging around the pool and going to the beach in.

I used both shirts every day that I was in Mexico and they were awesome. They fit well, dried fast, and kept me from getting burned. My skin was just as white returning home as when I left for Mexico, so they did their job. =) Of course, that wasn't the only reason I bought them. I'm not in the shape I used to be, so I spared the people at the resort from seeing my big white belly. =P

These shirts are fantastic...I highly recommend.

"This is a tour de force. Davies stands the  Anglo-Franco-centric stance of most Western historians on its head. He shows how differently history looks when viewed from a German-Austro-Hungarian-Polish perspective. The big  threats to Europe did not come from the West but from the East. Where would  Europe and America be without the energy expended to resist the Turks,  Mongols, and Muscovites? Agincourt looks rather small beer when compared to  Zbaraz, Beresteczko and Vienna. Davies gives a fresh look at the importance  of Central Europe to our culture and civilization. Nobody who reads this  book will ever view the history of Western Civilization the same way.",1
"How do I describe Focus On Me? Specifically all the feels Riley and Colin gave me?

I have to start by thanking Megan Erickson, again, for telling their story. What a beautiful, emotional story it was. I wanted to give Riley all the hugs in the world.

Much like the previous book (Trust the Focus), Focus On Me has it all  sweet, tender moments; super sexy ones; a few laughs, and a lot of heartache, but it's worth it in the end. Riley goes through hell, but he survives it, with Colin by his side.

I loved that Erickson didn't try to sugar coat anything. Riley had problems with depression, and even with all the love, f*&ks, and hugs from Colin, the depression wasn't going to magically disappear. Some authors, I'm sorry to say, seem to think love instantly cures all. No, it doesn't, but love can help a person to get through the tough parts, and there's no doubt that Colin was able to help Riley with that.

Once again, my Kindle copy is full of highlights. I look forward to whatever Erickson has for us next  but, please, can you go a little easier on my heart next time? (pause) Who am I kidding, that's why I love this series so much. Keep the emotions coming!

"Nice and simple pot. Has six hour timer, however, would like to have a longer delay for the day use. Also, when using the timer, it always resets the final temperature to 190 degree. Would be nice if it can ""remember"" the previous temperature setting. The inner container is coated with floury charcoal, not teflon coating that any other brands offer. It claims to bring out the fine taste of water. To me, at least it looks better than the grey teflon coating. Another feature missing is it does not come with the audible alarm.

Extra spec that I would like to know before ordering:
Power: 700 Watt
Temp setting: 140, 180, 190, 208

"This book was enjoyable and an entertaining read.  It was nice in that the book engaged me and took my mind off of anything other than the book while I was reading it.  I chose this book after seeing the cover for the latest Maisie Dobbs story and liking the picture wanting to know more.  I decided to start with the first book in the series after reading reviews by other readers and a few professionals.

I enjoyed the transition from the curreny mystery back into Maisie's background to help develop her character which added some mystery itself.  The shift back to the mystery at the end tied everthing together nicely.

I am encouraging my wife to read the book and share it with her book club.  I will likely read more of the Maisie Dobbs series.",1

"My 2 year old daughter and 5 year old nieces absolutely love this toy! The playset comes with a pretty Cinderella figure, the carriage that has molds built into it, and 3 jars of Playdoh. We love that the carriage has molds you can press the Playdoh into to make the fairy god mother, her dress skirt, Jaq, Gus, birds, and a pumpkin. The Playdoh presses easily into them and comes out easily as well without ruining the mold you just made and it's easy to peel away the excess Playdoh around it. Her favorite is that the wheels of the carriage have brick imprints and Cinderella's slipper to make a stunning walkway for Cinderella to walk on. The top of the carriage is really neat that you can press it down and make pumpkin vines. The carriage itself is gorgeous and colorful and doubles as a working rolling carriage for Cinderella to ride in as well as for making the molds.

The plastic carriage is thickly made and very durable to handle even rough play from younger kids. My daughter also likes to reenact the story with the molded figures and so it can be used for dramatic play as well. She also uses her other Disney Princess figurines to interact with Cinderella, though we don't put Playdoh on them. I love the creativity and old school fun this toy offers without any ritzy technology like most toys these days.

The only downside to this toy is that it's hard to clean the Playdoh out of the vine press, but that's to be expected. It would've been nice to have a cutting tool included too. Overall, this is a big hit in our house and well worth the price, plus you can buy more Playdoh colors to go with this!",1

"Your mileage may vary... The 1st two orders were great. Pate, like anyone would find for their cat or dog.

HOWEVER, my last batch was itchy, gooey, and gross.  My cats still eat the crud, but now with them having to clean their tongue of the gooey mess it is.

I JUST ORDERED 2 NEW CASES, so if they are like the last batch. They are going back to Amazon because of crap quality control.

I gave this product 5 stars earlier, however, their last product sucked!!!

To sum it up... Great ingredients, and great for your cats. But how about not making it gooey stinking goop?

You need better quality control. My cats are about to give up on this food because it comes out as goo. I've even put it in the refrigerator, and it's still the same goop.

I will post later, and if I got the same goop as before.... I'm sending it back.

"This 2000 Israeli film is as fresh as today's headlines.  Set in a settlement in Israel it's about a radical rabbi and his ardent followers, two best friends who compete for the rabbi's daughter, and the ongoing conflicts of orthodoxy and secularism in Israel.

The film is as bleak as the landscape around the settlement.  And the rabbi's radicalism is the one thing that keeps the young men bound together.  One of them is in the army and creates a religious unit much to the concern of his superiors who distrust the radicalism, even though the soldiers perform well.  Another young man is the scholar and the rabbi wants him to marry his daughter.  Alas, though, she prefers the soldier.  Trouble follows.  She leaves the settlement and goes to the city where she finds an apartment with some other religious young women.

Her rejection of her religious suitor, however, pushes him to plan to commit a radical act and he involves the soldier as well as another innocent friend in the plan.  How this all plays out is scary, as we are all aware of the potential violence of terrorist attacks.  This film brings this all out as well as some complex psychological factors.

The problem was that the story moved a little two slowly for my taste.  Also, as it was a foreign film, I know that it lost a lot in translation.  It seemed as if some parts were missing and the narrative seemed to jump round awkwardly.  So, in spite of its message and the tension raised regarding what would happen next, I found myself looking at the clock and feeling bored.  However, the film had an interesting theme and the acting was excellent.  It also showed me the world through a unique point of view.",1

"I wanted a compact rain shell for traveling; it is better to pack layers instead of carrying a big coat. This rain jacket is impenetrable to water when I run a sleeve under water, and it is completely dry afterwards. I have not used it in the rain yet.

I bought the jacket ""big"" so it could be a shell and I could layer underneath it (with a packable down coat, fleece, and/or hoodie). On its own, the jacket looks comfortable and cut nicely, but not big. I am 5'6"" 105 lbs and bought size medium for growing room (I like jackets loose anyway), but it already looks great as it is.

This jacket has features I did not expect, including elastic around the bottom hem (length comes to mid pelvis) and the around the hood for cinching. There is a mesh flap in the back for breathability. These are great features. I noticed the hood is not oversized at all. Cinched up, I think I could probably keep my face dry.

The tag on my jacket said it was $60, but I got it for less than $28; love the Amazon price! It also says it packs into itself, but I cannot figure out how to do this. I rolled it up and am using hair bands.

I dropped the rating because the color represented is not the color I received, even though I like it. ""Bright rose,"" instead of being a dark magenta as is shown, is just darker than hot pink. I'm not picky about my pinks though, so I'll wear it. This color would be cheerful on a wet day, but it will stand out in a crowd.

"To being with, it's very important that we pay attention to the exact subtitle of this book-this is ""vampiric"" erotica, not ""vampire"" erotica.  While all of the stories revolve in some way around parasitic characters, only a few of them are the classic warm-thick-blood-sex vampire erotica.  Most of the stories are at least creepy, and a few are quite scary.

As wth any collection of short stories, not every story will be to every person's taste, as you can see from the reviews here.  In particular, the story ""The Dripping of Sundered Wineskins"" seems to elicit a love-it-or-hate-it opinion.  Personally I loved it.  I enjoyed all of the straight vampire tales, especially, of course, Neil Gaiman's excellent opening tale, ""Snow, Glass, Apples"".  Other notable vampire stories were ""Ceilings and Sky"", Whispers in Walled Tombs"", ""First Date"", and ""Bloodlight.""

Unfortunately, though, there are several stories I hated, too.  ""Armies of the Heart"" was one, and I really, really hated ""When Memory Fails"" and ""The Fly Room.""  Eyeball-sucking?  Little mouths hanging around where they shouldn't be? Yeuch, no thank you!  And ""Bela's Plot"" I unfortunately just did not understand.  Were there actual vampires, or just sadists?

All in all, the book is worth it if you like spooky stories, and many of them are written in a slow-moving and descriptive style that gives them an erotic feel, but if you're looking for Vampire Erotica, you won't find much of it here.",1

This book has the potential to be a great series for a variety of reasons. First, it is a quick, easy read with a good story line. Second, it is a well-written story. I am very excited for the next installment. Third, the characters are well developed and the writing is nicely done. Fourth, the storyline is a well-written story. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys an easy, fast read with good characters and a great ending.",0
I thought it would be a fun book to read. I did not understand how the author could write,0
"Just to correct some other comments, the present book is only ""Jane Eyre."" It is not a collection of books by the Bronte sisters as implied in the spotlight comments above.

This is a great read. I bought this Oxford Classic after reading some very negative comments by Virginia Woolf in her polemic ""A Room of One's Own."" There she thought that Charlotte Bronte had gone overboard mixing fiction with her own conservative views of feminism. So, I was eager to see how bad this book was.

This is a great read and I read the book almost non-stop for two days. It is hard to put down. This was Charlotte Bronte's first successful book and it is her best. I am reading her next book written after ""Jane Eyre"", ""Shirley,"" and it is not as clearly structured. The present book is similar in some ways to that great classic ""Madame Bovary"" in that it is compact, concise, and consists of a well formulated plot; and, it has one strong central protagonist. It is a clear and compelling read. By the way, the character is almost the complete opposite of Madame Bovary in terms of morals.

One can quibble about parts of the story since it relies to some extent on coincidence and luck. Those parts lack realism.

The book was attacked by Christians at the time of publication almost 160 years ago and later by feminists. But that is secondary.

This Oxford version has a good analysis. It has a biography of Charlotte Bronte and comments on her sisters. The Oxford introduction by Sally Shuttleworth places the book in histrical context. Also, extra notes are included on the text. I read the comments after reading the book, and the less you know about the plot before reading the book better off you will be.

This is simply a great read.",1
Only 3 out of 4 bulbs worked. I have been using them for 3 weeks now and they are all turning black. They look terrible if they are off. My first impression was good deal but not at all after 2 weeks it went downhill.,1
These roasting forks are awesome!  Great for all sizes of foods; marshmallows to large sausages.  The rotating and telescoping functions are wonderful.  The length is great for our small back yard fires up to bonfires on the beach.  We had a reason to contact the company and they handled our inquiry quickly.  I would definitely recommend this to others and have already done so!,1

My dogs have been on Taste of the Wild for years.  They do great on it.  I am pleased to know that Amazon carries it.  Thank you.

"Summer is a good time to sit back, chill out, and pick up a romance novel or two.  Its not taxing.  The light reading stirs up memories of our own youthful days and is a welcome holiday for the brain.  Unlikely Love was a good choice.

Three sisters return to their childhood home to attend their father's funeral.  Estranged from each other and their father for many years, they are pleasantly surprised at the transformation of the Bed and Breakfast from ramshackle to opulent resort.  They are to inherit this new found wealth ... or are they?  There are conditions, complications, and a good dollop of romance laced with suspense, to say any more would be a giveaway.  It's a page turner good for a quick read under the shade of a tree.",1

"I love my Healthy Human bottle! I have one. My husband has one. We have the metal pint glasses. It's super rare to find a company that ALL their products are really that good. And to make it better- my bottle didn't seem to keep cold when I first got it more than a regular glass did. I emailed their customer service and same day they sent me a new one and were super friendly. Awesome customer service.
Yea, 32 bucks is pricey for a water bottle but it is well made. I am terrified to bonk it against anything accidentally- it's pretty loud from the double wall and has a very loud clang it makes sounding like you broke it (it's actually really sturdy)

But it does what it says! The finish is awesome and durable, the handle is great. If you are tearing through Amazon looking for a great insulated bottle, this is it. Trust me, I did the research. This is up there with Yetis, S'well, etc. It's aweosme but way more functional.",1

"I had such high expectations for this book. I have been wanting to read it since it came out and finally got the chance to read it. Well the first chapter was good. It was enticing. It had its own little plot and likeable characters. Then came the second chapter and that was also okay. Less exciting, more people to meet. Then the third chapter came along and there were WAY too many people. A whole band of them, at least one of which who had a regular name and then a nickname and that was just too much. And then the fourth chapter, which was yet more characters, not just one or two, but a whole passel of them, some of whom are using their real names and also a nickname and it was just too much. I could not keep all of the characters straight. And I know that the book is told from a series of other characters' viewpoints about a couple of characters, but it's just too much. I could not handle all these people. I really liked the writing in the first chapter, so there's that. I just can't read books that throw way too many people at me all at once.",1

"This is a great clipper for the price. I got this clipper from Walmart for $45.00. Amazon had it for 64.00. Usually Amazon is cheaper. However I like the clipper. It did cut my dog (poodle) very well. I guess I can not say great because I had a Laube clipper and it was amazing. However at this time I could not afford it. I also ordered another clipper that cost a lot more money then this one and I returned it because it was to big and too bulky.

I kept looking at a lot of reviews and came upon this Wahl. The reviews of this item was amazing for the price. It is lite like my previous clipper. It did cut very well. The combs that come with it does pull somewhat but still works very well. One thing too that no one mentioned before is the blade does pop off so you can clean the blade. Just remember that it is so important to keep the blades cleaned and oiled. That is the life of the clipper. I really did not keep my previous clipper maintained like it should have. If I did I would not have to have bought  another clipper right now.

I am not new to cutting my poodle. I have been doing it for a little over 2 years so I have got pretty good at it and pulling hair out of ears, squeezing anal glands, cutting under the pads,and cleaning teeth. There is just so much more to clipping a dog.... I would buy it again",1

"The story was absoulutly horrible and on a rating from one to ten, it would be a negative five.  It would not be worth a cent, to even a book deprived orphan.
  For starters, it has no plot, whatsoever.  The closet thing to a plot that can be found, if you have the time and patience to look, it that, if your a mermaid, don't be annoying.
  For the mermaid in the story is beyond annoying.  She gets to the point that you just want to wring her scaly neck.  She talks back, is stubburn and rude.  And yet the two main characters in the story LIKE her!
  The story starts with these two incredibally boring girls who (fortunatly) are moving away from each other, soo.  I don't know if I could stand another sentance of ""I'll miss her so much"" or ""I wish I could go back in time.""  They the spoiled mermaid and set her up with this nice guy, who, incrediable, likes her.  It would be more likly that he would be struck by lightning, than to the find and like this mermaid.
  But all bad things can't last for forever, much to my pleasure, and the mermaid goes back to the sea, before dieing from lack of salt (booo!!!).  Then, in the end, the guy must turn into a fish, or something, because he goes out to live witht he mermaid.  They should have just had the mermaid into a fish fillet.

I got this through vine but it is not something I would purchase.  My wife said she saw it at Target for $40.  This is not worth that price in my opinion.  It looks cool.  The different hats make Elmo say different things which adds new flavor to a toy that really wouldn't keep my kids attention.  They were excited to get it in the mail.  My 3 year old was done with it in less than an hour.  Our 15 month old occasionally drags it around but really doesn't play with it.  It is shedding and was doing so right from the time we got it.  I keep finding little red threads from the toy on our living room floor.  It has an on off switch which took me a while to realize but that was my fault.  Overall it is just OK.

I have 3 Male Italian Greyhounds who have very hard to fit body shapes. If you can make a few quick stitches you can make the Gooby fit like a glove. The Gooby has an open V neck. I lay one side of the V over the other side of the V.  I then sew it together making it fit their skinny necks.  This also keeps the Gooby from sliding back next to their penis. This prevents the Male IG from peeing on their Gooby.  I use their Girth (chest) measurement to purchase the correct size. I will attach a picture of my Gooby already sew together.,1

"You can make plans and decide what your path in life will be.  That is all well and good, but... sometimes life has other plans for you and no matter how stubborn you are about staying in the path you have chosen, you will need to adapt and accept that nothing in life is perfect.  It is out of those imperfections, or deviations if you will, that life presents us with challenges and triumphs we may have otherwise missed.

Our story follows Sophie as she is about to achieve her life-long desire to become a teacher. She has done everything in her power to put herself through college while supporting her brother and her wheelchair-bound father.  It has taken incredible determination and self-control to achieve this.

When William comes into her life, she recognizes there is something special between them.  Letting this unique attraction grow is both scary and invigorating.  How they recognize this feeling is mutual and growing is the constant undercurrent to our story.

In the end, we walk away knowing life is full of challenges.  A well-planned future has to be adjustable.  We must bend to the unexpected trials we find along our way to our future.  Love is the constant and family sustains us.",1

It is not as loud as I expected after reading other reviews.  I put ours on the bathroom counter for our cat and you can only hear it if you are in the bathroom.  It sounds like a water fountain which I think is nice.  Several people have complimented it not realizing it was a cat water bowl.  The cat loves it and took to it right away.  Now he gets all the water he wants and we don't have to wash our hands under a cat head.  I add water to it every day and wash it once a week which is pretty low maintenance.  It is top rack dishwasher safe which I love.",1
"Twyla looks quite different than pictured.  In person, my overall impression of Twyla is that she is less cutesy and has more of an intense/forlorn presentation that is appropriate for a monster like her:  The Daughter of the Boogey Man.  Twyla is all moonlight and shadows - her main colorways are a waxy mint green and her favorite color burple (which according to her is blue mixed with purple).  Twyla's skin is a very light purple which gradually changes to smoky gray on her forearms and hands.  She has silvery smoke patterns that start at her ankles and reach up her calves.  Twyla has purply-pink eyes, frosty pink lips and cute little dimples at the edge of her mouth.  I love her bright mint green eyebrows and her long soft minty green hair with  burple streaks.  As others have mentioned, a fun thing about Twyla is that the whites of her eyes glow in the dark!  (I thought her hair might glow as well, but sadly, no.)

Twyla is a new character - she is 15, shy, and hides under ""normie"" kid's beds to catch bad dreams.  She has the best Monster High Pet yet:  a purple dust bunny named Dustin.  Twyla is one of the smaller scale MH dolls - the same size as Howleen Wolf.  She wears a blue and black elbow length blouse and a tiered black and mint mini skirt with purple net ruffles.  Her accessories are a mint green belt and bracelet, a purple and black handbag with a cobweb and purple and black heels.  Her best accessories are her silver earrings that are a silver Victorian style door knob and lock-set.  She comes with a doll stand, hair brush and diary.

I know a lot of collectors are excited about Twyla and the new 13 Wishes Doll line.  Twyla is a great original new character.  Monster High does not disappoint.",1

"I wanted to like this.  It seemed like it would be perfect for travel - I wouldn't have to haul chargers,  just cords & this strip.  Well,  I just tried everything out.  The 3 power outlets all work,  but only 1 of the 3 usb ports works.  Guess I picked the wrong power strip.  I don't I know how hard it will be to return or exchange it, but due to 2 of 3 usb ports being dead,  its not much better than any cheap old power stripI have laying around. Glad I ordered far ahead of travel so I can find an alternative.

"I've read so many forum streams about ""skirt or no skirt"", which toilet is the ""best"" and so on, it too me a few hours to digest all the feedback. However,  I especially wanted a toilet that doesn't give me grief when I clean it. I am very happy, no, I'm ecstatic about this toilet. Yes, it probably cost more than perhaps a standard toilet, but it s finally something that I enjoy cleaning - yes, you read that right ""ENJOY""! It also goes will with our modern bathroom design and we wanted a ""short"" toilet because of space restrictions and this one fit the bill perfectly. It functions fine with the two flush options. And I like that it toilet seat closes slowly :)

Let me give a shout-out to the many people in forums and on Amazon, who helped me with their feedback. It has been exhaustive to read all about toilets (but thankfully most of us don't need to do that very often!),  and it did indeed help us make a decision. We can't be happier with the choice we made - so, thanks everyone!

Price on Amazon was very competitive and it arrived in two pieces. Our contractor hadn't installed one of these yet, and it was different to what he was used to. But it seemed to be quite easy!

Got this for Christmas last year. Had 2 6.5s and a bridged 12 hooked up. Ran 0 gauge from battery and ground and 12g to speakers. Worked well for about 6 months. Around July or August it started having issues channels failing in an odd way. Any amp Ive had in the past that has gone bad the channel stayed dead. It developed a whine in one speaker and then channels would randomly cut out until you turned it off for a few minutes and back on again. This would cut out in one channel one day and another on a different day. Rechecked wiring and all is good. Distortion is bad at higher volumes and bass is very muffled. For the price it sounded as expected and for the time it did work it worked ok. I did expect it to last longer than it did.,1

"We put this in when we renovated our kitchen wanting to have the newest neato tech.  It would work fine for a couple months and then go on the fritz, either not responding at all or randomly turning on when nobody was in the room.  I am pretty handy, I have dissembled, cleaned, and reassembled it several times now but it never lasts for long.  The whole system is based on the fact that when you touch it you ground it out, yet there are numerous components below the sink that are not insulated, and if they happen to touch something conductive (like, oh, I don't know, a PIPE?) it renders it useless or triggers it when nobody is around.  I went through several iterations of mounting the batteries up and away, insulating the pipes to prevent the hose/weight from touching etc all to no avail.  In addition, the soap dispenser that came with it is plastic crap, it's not even metal, just a facade that looks like metal, it broke within a few months.  Delta replaced that part, but still, do you expect a $300+ faucet set to break in 3 months?

The reason for the one star is that after the the fourth usage it broke completely in half, when I simply lifted the stone out of the oven.  It was already a week outside of the return window because I don't make pizza at home that often.  I am not sure why it broke in half.

There's a nice amount of variety in the pieces. The pieces are sturdy and have a good amount of room to go around. There are some really cool things in there.

My only complaint is that the markers are small. They seem to be about the size of a quarter. I don't know if this is a problem with the markers or if the markers are too small. But I can't say for sure.

The kit comes with a nice set of four pieces. There are two sets of matching markers.

The kit includes a matching set of 10 pieces.

It comes with a set of 20 pieces.

"I purchased this at Bed Bath and Beyond 15 months ago. It squeegees the glass very well, and the suction cup fixture stays up. (It detached just once, in the seasonal change from humid to dry weather.) No rust, and the rubber blade has stayed flexible. The folding design keeps the squeegee off to the side, out of sight.

Yet, I'm unhappy: the folding pivot point has loosened over these 15 months. If it was just a bit ""wiggly,"" that might be okay. However, the pivot and its fold-lock mechanism are obviously parting ways. The squeegee is no longer effective because the blade cannot be held perpendicular at the end of the swiveling handle.

My experience with this squeegee is similar to other ""simplehuman"" products I've used in the past. They look well-designed, with an aesthetic similar to Oxo and other neo-design products. But, their engineering has invariably incorporated flaws that eventually destroy the product's usefulness. I'll be replacing this squeegee with one from another manufacturer, and not purchasing from this line again.",1

"I have been on Eugene Peterson kick recently. The more books that I read from him, the more I am drawn to his writing. He is wise, earthy, and poetic, a wonderful combination. Reversed Thunder: The Revelation of John and the Praying Imagination (1988) was the most recent.

In Reversed Thunder, Peterson explores the creative and imaginative language of St. John in the last book of the Bible. In my experience, many books about the Revelation of John attempt to provide a key to the events of the book as a type of apocalyptic road map. In other words, many books claim to have found the key to the end times and are eager to share their findings. This book is refreshingly different.

In the introduction, Peterson wrote, ""I do not read the Revelation to get additional information about the life of faith in Christ. I have read it all before in law and prophet, in gospel and epistle. Everything in the book of Revelation can be found in the previous 65 books of the Bible...I read the Revelation not to get more information, but to revive imagination."" Later: "" I have taken the position that this book does not primarily call for decipherment, as if it were written in code, but that it evokes wonder, releasing metaphors that resonate meanings and refract insights in the praying imagination.""

To be honest, this is the first thing I have read about the book of Revelation that I have actually benefited from, actually enjoyed. Peterson, a poet in his own write, writing about the poetry of St John is a lovely gift. If you are someone who has been confused by the book of Revelation, I would commend Reversed Thunder to you.  It is well worth the time.",1

NOTE: I found out all Clementine fan pulls have gold chain.  Seller was very helpful since I wanted the chain to match the fan metal.
Also Bought their hotwheels Chevy SS on Silver chain~garage fabulous!  I live in Florida and every room has ceiling fans (some 2) which most have lights and fan pulls.  These are awesome! Adorable.

"Maybe it was just me, but the way this one was written made it really hard for me to get into the story.  I was constantly sighing, rolling my eyes and thinking ""really, please tell you you did NOT just say that!"".  The romance was a one-day instalove that was so corny it wasn't entertaining, believable or even likeable.  The ""fight scenes"" were a joke (it was like watching a movie fight where the camera is pointed at their feet) .....sounds terrible right?  It was! There was no incentive to read another book at all.",1

"Other reviews have described the book as ""the best"" of its kind, and I'm not.

I had a lot of fun with this book, but I was not as enthralled as I was in the first book. There are some parts that I find amusing, but mostly it's just a quick read. I'm not sure if it's a good book or not, but I will say that it's pretty good.

The story itself is very well done, with the introduction of a lot of new characters. There is also a little bit of romance in this book, but it's not that bad. The main characters aren't that bad. They just seem to be sort of stuck in the past. It's a nice way to introduce new characters and introduce a lot of new ideas.

I think I'm going to give this book a four star, but I have to say that I didn't like the ending, and I really didn't like the way the author ended it. I was very disappointed with the way the book ended. I was hoping for a more more ""real"" ending, and that would have made the story more interesting.

I have to say that I'm not a big fan of the old relationship between the two main characters. I thought the relationship between them was well-developed and had some interesting twists. But, again, I don't think the author had a lot of fun in the way of the main characters.

Overall, I liked this book very much, and I'm not sure that I'll be reading any",0

She made a great buy choice.  It doesn't run out of batteries quickly and it stays soft and cuddly when being squeezed each night by a little girl.  Good buy!

The best science fiction series ever written. I recommend this series to all devoted fans. Excellent story and well written.,1
"There's 14 of these now so people should know that THESE ARE NOT TRADITIONAL ANIMATION.  If you go in expecting the 90's X-men cartoon you will be very disappointed.  This is merely a limited animation rendering of the artwork with music and voice acting.  In this case it's pretty well done and I personally think they are getting better as they go on.

This one is a lot more ambitious then the prior installments in terms of action.  I originally thought this would be another Wolverine story but it does a good job at show casing a range of characters.  I enjoyed the Terminator by way of super heroes plus some Robocop for good measure story even if Jason Aaron can be hit or miss with me.  The voice acting is improving as well and I've come to accept Brian Drummond as a pretty good Wolverine.  Besides he's Canadian so he's a shoe in.

It was cool to see a rather under used character like Deathlok get show cased.  I hope Marvel Knights starts to move more in this direction as they continue.  Also surprised they couldn't interview Aaron for this.  Made the special feature seem less interesting.

Another complaint is I didn't think it was made clear that the Deathlok internalizing is supposed to be the same one every time.  With that little bit of spoiler free information the whole thing makes a lot more sense.  They still don't explain him that well though or why he has Wolverine claws and an Ironman hand.

Anyway let's see some more.  Ghost Rider, Moon Knight, Iron Fist, Dr. Strange, Hawkeye, who is next?",1

We solved that by closing/folding them closed first and pressing hard with a metal serving spoon and creasing and reinforcing that folded hinge area, and then placing them in the donuts. It worked great!

We scattered them on tables, in among bags of pretzels and wrapped candy, and also placed these in big glass jars with spooky printed labels we stuck on the fronts. They're small, so only the kids could really wear them comfortably, but they worked great for our purposes.",1

"I Am Legend DVD

I am Legend stars Will Smith as a scientist who has survived a deadly virus that was developed by genetic engineering to kill cancer; instead it has killed off most of mankind.  Smith struggles to live in New York City with his German Shepherd dog surrounded by cannibalistic super strong zombies that only come out at night.  This is a jarring apocalyptic movie that speaks well of Hollywood.  I'm glad that someone in Hollywood is reading Science Fiction.  There's a ton of science fiction books that could be made into good movies.

This movie is based on the novelette&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Am-Legend/dp/0765318741/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Am Legend</a>

"Great kit for the money - similar priced items on Amazon and in stores are junk and prone to stripped threads and broken plastic. This is a solidly crafted set of pistol cleaning tools, with all-metal rod and slotted tips, and an actual metal bushing in the plastic handle.

It does NOT have a bronze brush for a 32, but does have a designated cotton swab and slotted tip. It has a dual-purpose 44/45 bronze brush, 44/45 cotton swab, and slotted tip.

CALIBERS:
-22 family (223/5.56, 22 Short, 22lr, 22 Jet, 22wmr, etc)
-32 family (32acp, 32sw short/long, .327mag, etc)
-9mm family (38spl, 357mag, .380acp, 38 super, 9mm para/luger, 357sig, etc)
-40 family (40sw, 10mm Auto, etc)
-44/45 families (44spl, 44mag, 45acp, 45lc, 45-70, 45gap, etc)

PROS:
- Almost all metal parts (rod, brushes, tips)
- Plastic handle is made to last, has metal bushing (these typically break first)
- Small durable case, easy to stow in range bag, sturdy clasps

CONS:
- Lacks 32cal bronze brush, but has two 22cal bronze brushes?
- Rod is short, and may not be suitable for 8""+ barrels
- Difficult to remove some parts from case (handle)

4/5 stars because it really ought to have a 22 and a 32 bronze brush, rather than two 22 bronze brushes.

First timers, remember to buy lubricant and a barrel solvent/cleaner, and be sure it won't harm your polymer framed handgun! Hoppes is good but there are many other brands that work well. An old dress shirt can be cut up to make a lifetime supply of cleaning patches - don't waste money on fancy ones.",1
"Sturdy and well built, the jaws would meet nicely except the cutter is what stops them 1/64"" from closing. I will hone down the cutter jaws and it will work well enough.",1
"I'm not a sci fi fan, but this book is good enough to make me think about how we can make the world a better place.  The characters are likable, and the setting is a beautiful one.  The main character, Tori, is an excellent writer.  I love the way she writes, the way she creates the characters, and the way her writing is so different.  This book is a must read for any sci fi fan.This is a great book for any age. It is the perfect book for any age.This is a great book for a beginner or intermediate level runner.  It is easy to follow and has great photos to show how to run.  The book does a good job of explaining how to run.  I would recommend it for anyone who wants to learn the basics of running.",0
This book will rock anyone who has read the Kinsey Toner series.  She does not disappoint.  Great story and I look forward to the next one.This is a great book.,0
"I didn't see size options when I ordered, so the one i received was too large but seemed to get the job done. The zipper can snag a little but otherwise no complaints.",1
"I have always liked Wacom products and that includes its Bamboo styluses. The one I have used before just had a pen clip which actually worked well for my iPad case. I have always liked the styluses that are able to plug into the headphone/speaker port because I don't use it often so I it makes sense to have a solid place to keep my stylus with my iPad.

This product is reminiscent of the elago, which also has the retractable and speaker port pen feature. It also includes some colored rings that you can swap out for customization, though I think the silver looks the cleanest and most expensive.

The functionality is fine. It writes well and fits in your hand well. I'm just not a big fan of the girth of the product but it does allow for better grip and writing. However, the rubber grip does make the product look a bit cheaper, as it has dots in them and holds onto lint and dirt strongly and easily.

For the price, I think the elago is a much cheaper and comparable option. This product just doesn't look as sleek and clean as the other styluses in both elago or Wacom's repertoire.",1
"Well crafted and looks very nice. The only problem is that it's not really a vacuum, but a pair of the best",0
"I was looking for a pair of shoes with a comfortable fit.  These were the perfect fit.  The top is a nice, solid and comfortable fit.  I was very pleased with the purchase",0
This game is fun and easy to learn. It is a bit boring for my four year old.I bought this for my son for Christmas and he absolutely loves it. The only thing that I do like about it is the carpet. It is very thin and doesn't stay on for long. I would recommend this to anyone who has a kid who wants to play with their pets.We love this set.  It's a great addition to our collection!  My son loves to play with it and it is easy to assemble.  I love that it comes with two small pieces that each come with a lid.  This allows him to keep the lid on and to play with,0
Worst material. My dog chewed into it in ten minutes and he is a regular golden. I would advise not to buy this. Waste of money.,1
I like the functionality and convenience of the system. I also like that it's easier to install than an older system. The only negative is the plastic housing on the sensor is metal. I'll be buying another one for the door. I bought this to replace a broken one I had.,0
"For the price I bought 2. I am a little worried the grip, should it get blood on it, that it will become too slippery. For use on hogs, I think it will be fine. The hook is quite sharp too.",1
the love that won out is the story and how people in small towns can be judgemental.the women in this story have to overcome these types of people,1
Bought for my 16 year old son who is very picky! He loves them. The strap across the top of the foot has a fabric backing that keeps it from rubbing or scratching like slides with the adjustable Velcro straps. He has a narrow foot and these slides fit him well so I'd buy a size up if you have a an average to wide foot. I expected the slim fit per other reviews and purchased his normal shoe size hoping they would be a hit!  Can't go wrong with an UA gift for boys of all ages!,1
"Great quality and tremendous warm from the thick liner, which takes away a half size front and back. So, you need to order one whole size larger. I expect to get many years of cozy use out of these.",1
"Hmm.  The first novel was great.  This was...not as great.  Not sure whether it was a 3 or 4 star for me, I rated it as 3.

It just didn't grab me like the first one in the series did; the space battles were....not believable.  The internal political/military conflicts were again, not believable.  Riding the spaceship down to the planet and surviving was...not believable.

Just too many things that broke my suspension of belief.  Will buy the next in the series to see where it goes, but if it is the same as this one, probably the end of it for me.",1
"I still can't get over what a 'find' this film was.  I've never been to New Zealand, and the beautiful cities and seascapes alone were enough to give this film five stars!  The story line was educational.  I later did some research to better understand the Moari people.  That info would have been helpful before watching the film actually.  That added layer of obligation, and duty to his sense of origin would have made some parts of the movie easier to track.  While they did offer us some subtitles during more intimate tribal converstaions there were still words used that made no sense to a yankee like me.  The other thing I enjoy about foreign films is that they don't always tie everything up in a beautiful Tiffany box and bow.  This movie is no exception.  Life doesn't resolve itself in 2 hours.  The movie challenged it's viewers to think about life choices, desires, and the realtiies of following your heart.",1
I'm hooked on this writer and will be reading more of her work.,0
"This novela was charming! A sweet story of love, with likable characters and a great sense of humor. I laughed out loud several times. I am looking forward to reading Jen's other books!",1
"Having received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review, I voluntarily read and reviewed an Advanced Reader Copy of this book.  The opinions expressed are mine alone and do not reflect the views of the publisher.  I was not compensated for my review.The series was well written.  I liked the characters and the storyline.

"Rick Bragg is one of the most entertaining characters I've read in a long time.  This is a very well-written book, and I am sure you'll enjoy it as much as I do.

"Why is it so hard to say what the best part is?  Well, I don't really know. I've read a few reviews and have not been able to get it to go. It's not even a perfect toy. My daughter is still very young and still gets frustrated with it. I think it's a great toy and I think it's great for kids. I would not buy it again. It's just a good toy for young kids. I bought this for my son for Christmas. He loved it and it was great!  He is 6 years old and loves this. He likes it because it is big and it is made of wood. It does not come with any batteries and I can tell that it has had a few bad breaks and some slight splinters. But I'm happy with the purchase.",0
This series was the most enjoyable. The characters were well developed and kept my interest. I recommend this series.I had a lot of fun,0
I bought this because one of my friends thought it was hilarious. I really enjoyed it and am glad I did. I am a huge fan of Treme and it is so nice to have it in my collection. I will be watching it with my friends.,0
I gave it to a friend and she loved it. I will keep it for the next couple years.,0
These stories have a lot of twists and turns. They keep you engaged. Really enjoying them more and more.,1
Its a really snug fitting case.  I haven't worked with the case enough to get the gun where it slides in and out easily.  Also tends to slide the slide back when trying to insert into holdster since its a tight fit.,1
"After watching Hypocrites, it is interesting to me that even in the early years of filmmaking, movies could be extremely complex and thought provoking. Hypocrites is definitely those two things. The writer and director of the film, Lois Weber, uses the characters of a preacher and Truth (portrayed as a naked woman) to reveal the hypocrisy of society. Though Weber's intentions were most likely to speak on morality, it is interesting that she chose to use a fully nude woman throughout the film to draw in an audience that would not have otherwise seen the film. It was also surprising to me that this film would have been viewed by religious audiences with such unapologetic nudity. However, I will say that whatever could be viewed as indecent may have been made up for by the moral of the film. As the preacher succumbs to a dream, he is taken to an earlier time when he first finds Truth. The preacher then goes around aiming to show Truth to people, only to get rejected every time. In each situation, Truth reveals the true character of people to be corrupt. I feel that the overall story of the film was very well written. However, I found it a little bit difficult to get into the film because of the melodramatic style of acting. Because there was no sound in film at the time, the acting seemed to be more expressive and a lot less realistic. If anything made this film difficult to watch, it would be that. Although, overall I enjoyed the film and felt that Weber was successful in presenting her case of morality. I would be interested in seeing what a modern cast and crew could do with the story. I would love to see someone else's spin on it.",1

"My dogs are 9-lb Chihuahuas, and they LOVE these Buddy Biscuits Soft & Chewy Peanut Butter treats! l like that they are soft and easy for my dogs to chew, and the size is perfect for small breed dogs. Because they are soft treats, my dogs don't leave a pile of crumbs on the floor after eating these treats! I usually give my dogs each a few of these treats right before heading out the door whenever I have to leave the house; because these are peanut butter flavor, my hand doesn't stink like meat right after reaching into the bag to give them to my dogs! Major plus in my book!

Overall, I definitely recommend the Buddy Biscuits Soft & Chewy Peanut Butter treats for anyone with small breed dogs or dogs that prefer chewy treats! Just don't forget to close the bag after giving some to your dog(s), or the treats will harden up!",1

Batman Returns is a wonderful film. The story is very good and the characters are well developed. The acting is top notch and the story is very interesting.

"I really enjoyed the unique plot of this book. There is even a plot within a plot as the characters read about a romance in a story that the hero had penned. The hero's personality was refreshing as he wasn't arrogant or filthy rich or a rake. The heroine was past twenty, but a positive, confident well educated lady and quite likable also.",1
"If ur offended easily, or if you are just looking for a quick and fun read, this is the book for you. The characters are well developed and the story is well told.I enjoyed this book.  It was good, but it had some issues with the setting.  The first two books in the series were the most intense, but I felt like I was missing something.  I just didn't feel like it was all that special.  I think the author did a great job with the description of the location, but I felt like it was just a ""short"" story.  The description of the environment was very detailed, but the story",0
I ordered a size up just like one of the reviewers suggested.  Bad idea!  Stick to your size.  Large/xlarge size was so big that i felt like I'm wearing a clown pants.  I was totally swimming in the fleece skirt pants.  Pants is thick not very good material/fabric.  Not what i expected.  Definitely a return.  Giving it 3 stars because it's way too long not meant for shorter than 5'5 in height,1
"I won't repeat a book blurb you probably just finished reading. If you've read the first 4 books, then don't stop now! I just finished this one and am only pausing long enough to tell you to get this book. If you haven't read this series, start with book 1 because you don't want to miss any of this! Love the characters! The book is about demons and demon-hunters, but it's also about the love and strength/power of families. I read....a lot!! I don't normally gush over the books I've read, but I'm making an exception here! This author knows how to bring a story to life!",1
These books were about Anna and Cole Stevens. Anna is an art student who is looking to do her internship and Cole is a business owner and operator. Anna knows who she wants to do her internship with and who she doesn't and she does not want to do her internship with Mr. Stevens. She has heard all about Cole and what kind of photography he does and she wants no part of it. But some things occur and she ends up putting herself in a bad situation. Maybe there are things she doesn't know about Cole Stevens and things she can learn.,1

"As always, Grisham delivers very captivating story line. Rather than last me for a while as an ""occasional"" read, I blew through this one in just a few short days.  Character development is spot-on, and the depth of information about the challenges faced by Appalachian Miners is very revealing.  I was left somewhat disappointed by the fact that the author didn't take the story further and wrap-up more of the storyline.  I was also disappointed as I expected some follow-up editorial information/direction regarding the plight of the miners. Was it fully fact-based, an entertaining, yet trumped-up piece of fiction, or something else entirely?",1

"Buy the Region 2 DVD (released by Fabulous Films in 2008) from amazon UK. It's widescreen (*not* pan & scan), plus it comes with a Director's Commentary which offers good insights from Joseph Sargent (who also directed the original ""The Taking of Pelham One Two Three"").

Admittedly, it won't be cheap. Current exchange rate amounts to eighteen bucks plus shipping. But you'll then be able to enjoy one of the classics of science fiction. It predates WarGames by more than ten years, and offers a more realistic--if darker--vision of the future of computer intelligence.

UPDATE November 2009
Looks like this has been discontinued by the manufacturer. Wonder if that means a proper Region 1 release (widescreen) might be in the works? Maybe a 40th Anniversary Edition next year??",1
"I'm hard on running socks, and this is the best. I'm not sure if I would recommend this product, but I've tried a few and am happy with them. Great case! The only thing I wish it had a little more padding is the mesh flap on the back. The flap is a bit too tight, and it will hang out over the edge of the pockets if you use it on something that doesn't have a mesh flap on it. Also, the zipper is very tight, and I would not recommend using it on a backpack, since it won't fit into the front pocket. The case is a good size, and it holds the keys, car keys, etc.",0
You won't be disappointed in this figurine.  It's an exceptionally good quality and the features are really done well.  It's a great gift to a young teen.  My grandson age 13 really couldn't wait to get this.  He was on top of the world when it arrived.  He couldn't thank me enough.  Shows it off on his shelve proudly.  It's always good when the kids are not disappointed when they open a gift.  A little pricey but honestly for the quality it was worth it.,1
"Excellent quality, and Amazon had a good deal on the item. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very small, and the cover is very flimsy.",0

"I used these to nail some rg-6 coaxial cable to the wall and keep it out of the way. There's a bit of space, so maybe a 6 mm cable clip would've been a better option for the cable I'm using. But I couldn't beat the price, and it works well enough. Can't complain.",1
"THE SOLOIST is a fine novel, interweaving three stories that all center on the narrator: the rise and fall of a child prodigy cellist, the sole member of a jury at a murder trial who finds meaning in a defendent's case, and a teacher of a budding, gifted young Korean cellist.  Each story has its own cast of characters beautifully realized, but most important - each aspect of this tripartite novel is told with such informed authority that imagining the author in anything but an autobiographical mode is next to impossible.  Just as in his previous novel LYING AWAKE which dealt with  the inner thoughts of a cloistered nun, Salzman here shows us he has a thorough understanding of music, music making, and the sociology and philosophy of our court system and our education system.  Not that he stops at reportage. Hardly!  It is simply his depth of knowledge about everything he writes make his novels deeply committed and inspiring.  The reason for writing THE SOLOIST is probably one of encouraging his readers to live in the moment.  But it is the loving manner of relating his tale that gets us there, almost without knowing we've arrived.  A fine book to encourage a whole town (Pasadena) to read and share as is the goal here.  Well worth anyone's time.",1
I absolutely love the characters of this book.  Desiree made me feel like I literally have known every character all my life.,1

"This spray was used in conjunction with other flea and tick prevention strategies. I used it to spray bedding that the problem cat would sleep and lay on a lot. In conjunction with this and flea/tick shampoos we were able to get rid of the fleas. I was careful to use very very little of the spray as I am sure my cat was having a reaction to normal amounts. So while this product worked, I did not feel comfortable with using a lot. My cat began to drool a bit and that is a symptom of flea prevention stuff irritating them.

The spray bottle is around 6 inches tall and 1.5 inches in diameter.

Pros:
*Helped supplement flea and tick prevention strategy

Cons:
*Can cause a reaction in cats if used a normal amount(-1 star)

Additional Considerations:
Consider other natural means of flea and tick prevention. Whatever you use, you will have to use multiple things in order to get rid of your flea problem.

Overall: 4/5 stars (>=.5 rounds up, <.5 rounds down) => 4 stars

So I made something out of maple, drilled a 5/8"" hole in it, and tapped it with this. Then I poured in a bit of thin CA glue to strengthen the wooden threads and screwed the tap in one more time to cut the threads perfectly. Now I have a wooden live center to hold the back of bowls without piercing them. This tap was indispensable for that.",1

"The 810 is an awesome case don't get me wrong. I really like it and am glad I picked this case after doing some research. I gave it 3 stars because there were a few things wrong with the case I noticed while re-assembling my PC. First there were a few blemishes on the paint, not horrible but still noticeable. The paint itself seems like it could get damaged pretty easy. Second, a section were the PSU is mounted was bent, but it didn't hinder the installation, just a little OCD kicking in. Third, the LED light in the back doesn't work (not sure if i missed a plug or anything) so there's that. Fourth, the fan's are nosier than I expected but that's remedied with a fan controller.

All in all the case is still great and is a huge upgrade from an Antec 900. But the 810 did come with a few unexpected imperfections. Not sure if it's because I purchased my antec from newegg and the 810 from Amazon but the antec was in pristine condition even though it arrived in a beat up box. Expected the 810 to have nothing wrong since the box seemed pretty mint, but i was mistaken.

I understand stuff like this happens, but for $170 this case should have nothing wrong with it. As a side note the case is packaged in a semi-soft foam, which was partially destroyed upon opening the box.

Hopefully there is nothing else wrong with the case.

UPDATE
*just found out the LED is powered by a SATA cable. So 1 star is bumped up.",1

"If you like The Hobbit films, you owe it to yourself to get the Extended Edition.  Even though Steve Jackson did not give us as much extra material in the Hobbit films as he did in the Extended LOTR, the Extended Battle of Five Armies has substantially more material than the theatrical edition.  It also ties up some loose ends that exist in the theatrical film.  For people who like short, simple films, this entire series is too long.  For people who love Tolkien, and understand why a film cannot be the same as a book, it is too short.  Recommended.",1
"Don't believe what this product description says:  These are very nice clippers, but NOT for a small dog, and definitely not for cats.  These clippers are suitable for large dogs.  The blades are wide, so--when open wide--they don't fit between my small dog's toenails and threaten to bite into his pads.

But, for large dogs, this is a nice pair of clippers:  Very sharp blades, nicely beveled; the blades close smoothly, and the handles are easy to grip--if you have large hands.

I have long fingers and these handles, while easy to close, are kind of hard for me to get my hand around.

SIZE INFORMATION:  I'm adding this information based on a question I received in the comment section:
""Refer to the second and third picture down: Opened up, the handles 4 11/16"" from outside edge to outside edge. A tape measure all the way around the open handle shows 11 1/8"". At the blade end: Opened up, 1 1/4"" outside-to-outside of blades; 7/16 inside-to-inside of blades.""

"I wanted to like this really bad.  In fact I do! I own several pairs of Epic MMA's shorts now.  WODs mostly.  I put these on and it seems that the velcro is a little bit more aggressive than other pairs but the focus quickly changes when you are out and about.  The material is a good material, strong durable, and much thicker than expected. The slit on these shorts are fantastic.  Wish all my pairs had that high of a slit on the side.  But what I could not deal without was no pocket.  There is an inside flip pocket thing but is not really useable when the draw string is tied, and the shorts velcroed shut.

"Not since ""Plata Quemada"" has Argentina made such an amazing movie.  Soul-wrenching storytelling and amazing cinematography make this a must-see for anyone.  There's a camera angle in this movie, though perhaps helped by computer, begins high over a soccer (football) stadium, pans down over the field, beyond the goal, into the screaming crowd before focusing on one face, then follows the ""owner of the face"" down into the bowels of the stadium itself...SEAMLESSLY.  Not that the amazing camera work is the best thing about it, but I remember the first time I saw the movie thinking about that as it was happening.  Anyway, back to the story...it's epic.  Told somewhat in flashback, it covers over 30 years in the life of a government employee whose life was altered dramatically over choices made in his youth.

"I am a heavy sleeper looking for an alarm that will wake me up and give me that extra boost in the dark fall and winter mornings.  I have had no prior experience with these types of wake up lights, but decided to give this one a try through the Vine program.  It works for me and I love it.  This sleek, light-weight clock is about 7.5"" in diameter and runs by an electric adapter.  The time and alarm are easy to set with clear picture instructions.  About 30 minutes prior to the alarm time, the light slowly starts coming on, increasing in brightness until the alarm goes off.  To have the best effect, the clock needs to be close to your head, say 1-3 feet.  The light is surprising bright when set to maximum of 10, so bright that I wake up 15 minutes before the alarm goes off.  You can set the brightness to less if you like, but since I am such a snoozer, I leave it at max.  The alarm itself is plenty loud also.  There is a snooze feature, you tap the top for another 9 minutes, but with the bright light, hard to keep sleeping.  It can also be used as a light at night, avoiding clutter on the nightstand.  Only feature I would like to see is battery back up in case of power failure.  Have been using this now for a few weeks and feel more awake in AM with that extra light boost.",1
"When I asked to review this I wasn't aware that it was the third in a series.  It didn't make a bit of difference.  This book stands well on its own.  This delightful romance is filled with twists and turns and the occasional fall and you have to find out what happens next.  This story tells of the long road back to living by a widower writer and a librarian who has her own shadows.  The fact that they are each responsible for the life of a child plays well into the story.  This is a terrific read that will leave you with a smile.

They fit well and are very comfortable.I bought this for my son for Christmas. He loved it and it fits great!I'm a huge fan of the rose gold that I've bought at the top of this boot.  The reason I bought this boot was because it has a lot of cushioning.  I've had a few pairs of this boot and the ones that I've had have stayed on my feet well.  It was very hard to get them on and I thought it was a bit of a hassle but now I'm happy with this boot.

I'm 5'4"", 130lbs and these boots are a little narrow for me.  They are slightly wide but I'm not sure if it's because I have a narrow foot or if I'm just short on the toe area.  I just bought a small and it fit fine.  It was a bit of a pain to get it on but the leather is soft and comfortable. ",0
"For the cost, Im really disappointed in the quality. I bought this just over a month ago, and despite care taken while washing the bra is fraying and falling apart. Ive always used a mesh bag, on gentle cycle and I hang dry; it started fraying almost immediately. Ive attached a picture.

Maybe I got a defective item, but regardless the straps that do not snap off are very very thin and made with material that doesnt feel like it would last.",1
"Works well and as advertised. My older digital thermometers would always default back to Centigrade when there was a power change, but with the hard C/F switch these stay put.

"This is a awesome harness!  I love the long straps that hold the harness up in the air.

The harness itself is very comfortable and",0
"I had bought this to replace an older cell phone which was a lot thinner than the original one.  The extra thickness is nice, but it is not a huge deal.  The only thing that is hard to get used to is that it is not very compact.  The charger is small enough to fit in your hand and it is very easy to hold.  It has a standard length cord that will hold it in place if you hold it in place long enough.  The cord is very long, but I have not used it in a while.  I think it is a good idea to have a long cord that doesn't fall out",0
Works just fine for me. I don't need to move it around and we did twist tie it into just the right position.,1
Used for 2 weeks and works great.  It is a little heavy for my small size and doesn't move as easily,0

"I just received this this cable. The quality is good.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it's a bit too small for a laptop. The keyboard is small, and it's not in the same position as a regular laptop keyboard. But it's not the best laptop keyboard I have ever owned. I'm not sure if it's a design flaw or a problem with the cable itself. Maybe I just need to get some other cord to connect the keyboard to the cable.

I'd be happy with this cable if it was made by a company that doesn't make cables.I like this case because it has the included charger that makes it easy to charge my phone and laptop. I also like the color and the way the case is folded. It's a great little case for the money.Love the case and I would recommend it.Works great.I really like the mounting hardware but I didn't like the instructions on the other reviews.  This is a great solution for my Samsung Galaxy Tab S.  I love how it has a built in stand for the tablet, which is great.  The stand is a bit heavy to use",0
"This is definitely the cutest apron I've ever owned! It also seems to be treated with some kind of scotchguard or startch, as the material is very stiff (but also water resistant). I splashed some water on myself while I was doing dishes and it did not soak through to my clothes underneath! It is easily machine washable, though may require another treatment after a few washes to keep the stiffness and water resistance.

It falls just about at my knees, a perfect length in my opinion. The pockets are well crafted, but could be a little bigger.

The only gripe I have is that the cute low-cut V neck style leaves a lot of empty space to be filled by splashes and drips. I can see myself managing to get that area dirty since there is nothing covering my clothes.",1

"This is the best accessory ever developed for concealed carry. Purchase this for all of mine and love everything about it. No more slippery grip and it doesn't make it hard to holster or pocket it. Treat yourself to this, you won't regret it! Not a single issue ever. Stays on nice, doesn't slip or slide. Used a blow drier then put it in the freezer for 10 minutes. They also don't leave any nasty marks if you were to take it off (peels off nice and easy). Like many have done, I also custom cut mine (didn't install the back grip or front because I have a laser).",1

"Per other reviews the cloth versions for the G930 don't work properly and the only ones that work correctly is the black one.  Yet, the pillow for the black versions doesn't work for the G930!  Catch-22 for those who have disintegrating pillows and ear pads.

The title is difficult to understand, as it contains so much information.  Titles and information needs to be clear and not ambiguous and this item title could be much clearer.

While the ear pads look to be functional, what I got won't work 100% on the G930.  I really thought it would work.  Can't the seller be clear on what works?  Can't the seller provide a G930 BLACK ear pad and pillow?",1

This is a review of the quality of the Blu-Ray video. The film itself is awesome and you probably know that If you are reading these reviews. I have to say that this is one of the best looking Blu-Rays I have seen. This was one of those where I was amazed at the detail I was seeing on peoples faces.

"Just purchased this cat tree a week ago. It arrived quickly and was better than I imagined. The cat houses were large enough for my adult cats. I was worried they might be a little small, but they were spacious enough for one cat to fit in a house at a time and roll around or hide in it. This is my cats first cat tree condo and it won't be their last.

When I purchased this cat tree I saw that there were similar trees for less money, but I chose this one by Armarkat because the reviews said it was sturdy. I must admit this cat tree was easy to put together and it is extremely sturdy. My cats jump on and off and climb it without any wobbling. I have two cats and both are about 13 lbs. The carpet material is a little on the cheapy side, but the cats enjoy it so I can't complain. I purchased the Kong catnip and sprinled some on the cat tree and my cats are in heaven and happy to be up off of the ground. I purchased the 74"" tree and was concerned it might not be tall enough to make the cats feel secure, but it's plenty tall and spacious too!

If you are looking for a sturdy tree that your cat/s will enjoy I recommend this product by Armarkat.",1

"Hokay, so...to start Dean and Rosanna, let's just say it's one of the best stories I've read in a while.

Dean is the man who took a tumble and now he's had his chance to be a strong, independent man. This is a story of forgiveness, love, loyalty and a love that is always there.

I love Dean and Rosanna. They are such a wonderful couple. I am so happy for them and Dean. I love how they both have their moments when they're together. I really loved how they both let go of their past and went after their dreams. I love how they both forgive each other.

"I Heart Hollywood is the second book in the I Heart series by Lindsey Kelk. Angela Clark is back and she's still living in the United States, writing for a hip magazine, and debating whether to move in with her sexy new boyfriend. Her latest work assignment is interviewing fellow Brit and actor James Jacobs...in Hollywood. All is fun and glamorous until paparazzi snaps compromising photos of Angela and James Jacobs. The gossip spreads and threatens her job, reputation and relationship.

I really liked Angela's independent attitude and guts in the first book, I Heart New York. But she loses this burst of ""I Am Woman"" in this book. She seems helpless and clueless. I enjoyed reading more about her best friend Jenny, who is healing from heartbreak and discovering a potential new career. Hopefully Angela just had a temporary mental setback and will be back to normal. As Jenny says, ""You're my best friend. You do stupid stuff. I sort it out. This is our thing, it's the thing that we do.""

Lindsey Kelk's pop culture and smooth writing style make for easy, light reading. I love when a book takes me to different places in the world like New York, London, Hollywood, Vegas, and Paris. It's fun to read Angela's perception of the different cities. It's safe to say I am sticking with this series and can't wait to read the next two.

"These fit a bit larger than expected, but they are comfortable enough.

The only downfall is that the top is a bit narrow.  The fabric is not thick enough, so it hangs over my shoulders.  The dress is very short.  I usually wear a 7.5 and a 7.5 is the most I can wear.  If I had to go up a size, I would probably go up a size.  However, I will say that the dress is pretty close to my size.  The top is really nice and comfortable.

I wear a size 8, and the dress is a bit long, but it's not that bad.  The only reason I would give it 5 stars would be if you have a big chest.  If you're a medium, you might want to go up a size.  I will say that if you have a large chest, you might want to go up a size.

"I collect knives and tried this low priced traditional 'toothpick' from Buck.
Like a number of Bucks knives now, this is made in China, so I'll quickly hit a few potential quality control hot spots:

The jigged bone handle scales: mounted to the frame of the knife with no visible gaps or defects, no problem there. The jigging itself is deep and well defined, not REfined as on a Case knife, but it's low priced (an equivalent Case toothpick would cost you at least 5 times as much.) The bone material seems OK.

The blade: Evenly ground on both sides, came paper-shearing sharp (just shy of hair-shaving.) No defects. Bucks prolific 420HC steel- perfectly decent steel, Buck has a particularly good heat treat in testing. I own the Buck 119 special large fixed blade which uses the same steel.

The bolsters: Nice and glossy, the pins are buffed to near invisibility.

Blade pivot point: The blade snaps open firmly, no play side to side or up and down. It is of course a slip joint blade and does not ""lock.""

Overall, 9/10 for value. A fine choice as a gift, as a light duty every day carry pocket knife, or as a budget ""gentleman's folder"" (I bought it with this latter purpose in mind- it is thin, lightweight, and looks nice.)

In future I may try some of the competing low priced 'toothpicks' from companies like Boker, Columbia River Knife and tool, and Frosts ""Steel Warrior"" series.",1
"This is the best pan I've ever used.  I also own a Wolf Gourmet pan, which is good, but this Viking pan is even better!  It conducts heat so well that I cooked chicken breasts last night on my gas burner stove on the low to low-medium heat setting.  A 1.5 tablespoon pad of butter melted so quickly yet didn't burn, which made cooking so unbelievably easy.  I also love how deep the pan is, reducing (eliminating) grease splatter.  The three chicken breasts were very large but had plenty of room in this pan to cook completely evenly despite the fact that the flames underneath did not extend more than a couple inches out from the center of the pan.  Even my children noticed a difference in the quality of the meat saying how juicy and tasty the chicken was compared to how it's usually cooked, especially when the breasts are so thick.

Note, the instructions that come with the pan tell you to condition the pan with oil before first use and then every few months after.  I did condition the pan per the instructions and I'm glad I followed that tip ahead of time.",1

I am 5'4"", 165lbs and these are perfect!  I would definitely recommend these shorts to anyone. This is a very good holster. I like that it does not have any rubber on the holster.

"It's hard to find an actual set of these tools in the stores.  They are all pretty.  If you want to get a set that is as good as the ones I used to have, this is the one.

I'm hoping that when I buy another set of these tools, I'll have a set that does the same thing.

Bottom line:  These are really good.  I used them to replace the old tools that were replaced on the ceiling of my new home.  The old ones were too thin and didn't hold up well.  The new ones are much better.  I hope I'm buying a few more of these and they will last me a long time.

Update:  I bought two sets of these.  One set of these replaced all the old ones and the other one replaced all the old ones.  So, this was a very good deal.  The new set is much better.  I don't have any problems with the old ones.  The old ones were a bit stiff and the new ones are much better.  The old ones are well made and I like that they are plastic.

They fit perfectly in the toast over pan and work great for when you are baking items for easy clean up and non stick surfaces. They are perfect for baking cookies on or just protecting your pans from getting burnt stuck on foods on them. I really like that these fit perfectly in the pans that come with my toaster oven they are perfect for everyday use as well as just every so often.
They are very easy to clean, its like the cookies just slide off of these, I pick them up one side and they just slide off of the mat and onto your platter or others. I mean you can actually just wipe the sheets off with a cloth, I know that may sound silly but I don't ""wash"" these per say I am just worried that soap would be a little harsh for these kinds of baking mats so I just use really hot as my hands can stand water and scrub them with a wash cloth. I really love these baking mats they are great for anything that you are cooking. Oh cheese who hates baking cheese onto things? I know that I do! Because cleaning the pans are too hard to really want to do it but with these you don't have that problem with these mats the cheese comes right off with no problems.

"Season 6 of Stargate was a disappointment to some because we lose Daniel Jackson for a bit.  The stories continue to be strong, however.  Apparently our actor had a movie deal and left (mostly) for the year.  Still, he makes appearances (being ascended) from time to time and his replacement (an Alien with the ability to learn new things quickly) does a fine job.

Really, the season barely misses a beat.  And while Season 9 and 10 changes our cast radically with RD Anderson leaving the main spot (don't consider any of this spoiler alerts since the show's logo include pictures of the actors involved each year), Season 6 maintains our other characters (as well as Daniel Jackson from time to time) so it gets 5 stars from me.

"Being in the dentist's chair is usually an uncomfortable and anxious place to be, but this story turns it around and puts the dentist on the spot. As he pokes and prods with his instruments, he is soon distracted by his patient's new accessory. The doctor has seen plenty of tongue rings but never one quite like this. It's very odd and makes him feel as if someone is watching him. As he continues his examination, he is soon troubled and scared by what he finds.

This story is maybe a fifteen-minute read, but it doesn't short-change the reader that feeling of expectation. There is a nice feeling of suspense for the reader as we wait to see exactly what the good doctor will discover in what is supposed to be a routine exam. From the well-chosen book cover with its unnerving stare to the patient's startling and ominous revelation, it all comes together for a good and kind of creepy read.",1

"I bought one of these in large to try it out. The label was ""Urban Crews"". After washing it shrunk a little but was not a bad t-shirt for exercise (I like the extra length for stretching (no stomach shows)). I ordered another 2 shirts in XL Only ONE of the two were delivered. The label now said ""FWRD Denim Company"". It is a totally different type of material. Much cheaper and the make is also very cheap (not inexpensive...CHEAP).
So it appears the quality of the shirt you get is VERY haphazard. Is it Urban Crews or some place they farmed it out to.
The FWRD Denim Company shirt is made in Pakistan. It says it is 100% cotton just like the Urban Crew shirt but it does not absorb sweat like cotton. It just drips off like synthetic.

"If you haven't read anything in the Wine of the Gods series...book 18 is not a good place to start.  I really like this universe (multiverse?), but there are so many characters and so much about the world(s) that is hinted at it becomes a bit overwhelming.  Unless you have read the whole series and have the background.

That being said, for those of you who are fans this adds a wonderful new group of magic users to the mix.  Having some new blood to add to the already defined groups should shake things up nicely.  We also see more action by mage compass's, which is a nice change from the usual witches pyramids.  Some of the first hints of a coming tech/magic revolution that may make the industrial revolution look like a minor upgrade.  A whole new pyramid also is peeking around the edges.

Now for the bad:  Much as I like this world ^and^ the writing, this is not a good short story.  This is more of a chronology of what happened.  While some of the characters learned new skills or information, we did not.  More about filling in the blanks and backstory than developing a character.

There is a teaser at the end of the book showing the next(?) in the series that gives me a lot of hope.  The Sea Kings!!  An almost unexplored area.

In closing, I liked it.  Fans will like it.  Everybody else needs to start earlier in the series, if not at the beginning, and develop a love for this world in order to appreciate this story.",1

"I gave this as a gift, but we all enjoy it.  The frame has handy features and is easy to use.  One thing I didn't realize before purchasing was EXACTLY how one got the photos on the frame.  I saw the option to insert a memory card so I assumed there would  be a USB cable for transfer.  This isn't the case.  You need to put the photos on the memory card.  I didn't have a card reader, so I went to Wal-Mart and bought a 'holder' for my 4GB card for [..].  That essentially turned it into a 4GB USB memory stick.  Now I just plug that into my computer, add photos, and return it to the frame.  I enjoyed the included Kodak software.  It made it fast and easy to edit my pics, but it caused some incompatibility issues and I had to delete it.  If it will work for you, it is well worth installing.  I use my regular graphics program now.  The frame screen size of 5X7 sounds smallish, but actually is just fine.  We have it on a stand that is only about 4 ft. from the one chair and maybe 10 ft. from the other that we use regularly and the frame can be viewed fine.

"I bought this to mount Board Buddies on my Dewalt-744 table saw.  The saw has a 19.5"" fence, so I had to cut the aluminum slide on both ends with a hack saw so that the wood screw holes would be centered over an auxiliary wooden fence a.k.a feather board that I made.  The saw's aluminum fence is 1"" wide with screws on its back side away from the blade.  I had to replace the Dewalt screws with equivalent 2"" sheet metal screws to attach the featherboards.  I made the wooden fence out of two pieces of 3/4"" hickory so that it would be hammer-handle tough.  I needed two pieces to make the fence wide enough to take wood screws from the slider as it is 2 1/4"" wide.  The holes for the wood screws in the slider are set 1 3/4"" from the edge.  Ideally, one would make the featherboard out of one piece that is 1 1/4"" thick, but good luck trying to find some.

All went well until I had to screw the aliminum slide onto the auxilary wooden fence.  I drilled deep pilot holes.  But, two of the brass-colored wood screws provided with the slide snapped off when the screws got deep into the wood.  The first time it happened, I was able to recover by separating the two hickory boards and unscrew the stub because the screws fell exactly between the featherboards.  Then I decided to glue the boards together so that the screws would be more secure.  On my second attempt to mount the slider, a second wood screw snapped.  This one was much more difficult to extract.  I had to use a hand grinder to dig a pit around the stub so that I could get a lock wrench on it.

MY ADVICE:  use the stainless steel wood screws that are supplied with the Board Buddies instead of the cheap brass-colored screws that come with the slider.",1

"Persuasion is Jane Austen's last novel. The story is told from a point of view of the heroine.

I had a hard time following the plot, and the first two chapters seemed to go nowhere.  It was a little slow for me.  I found it hard to believe the story was about Jane Austen and the other characters.  I didn't like how she got into a relationship with a man who had a secret and then didn't tell her about it until later in the book.  It made the story slow, but I'm not sure why.

You should keep in mind the authors advice in order to create and maintain a consistent online business. It also encourages you to use social media as a way to make yourself known and keep improving. It focuses more on Amazon, even though you can use it as a start up to any other online selling platform!",1
"Someone posted that this was $20 at one point. At that cost, this isn't bad. It's currently over $28 and not worth that. It's very lightweight and is a bonus if that's what you're after, but it's also flimsy as a consequence.

My biggest gripe, though, is that the cushions don't hold the stock or barrel well. I built a rifle rest out of lumber and cut much deeper V notches to hold the weapon in place. The Caldwell cushions are much too wide and low. I have yet to find a rifle or shotgun that is comfortable in this rest.",1
I was hesitant to buy these based on some of the reviews. I can say after using them numerous times I love them.

You can mount this clamp anywhere on your work bench by simply drilling a hole for the supplied round headed bolt and then countersinking for the bolt head.  When the clamp is not in use the bolt will then drop flush with the work surface.  There's no open hole in the work bench like for a hold fast.  When you want to use it you simply reach under the work surface, push up on the bolt, slide the clamp onto the bolt head and clamp down your piece.  And you can make additional bolts to mount the same clamp at different places simply by rounding the hex head on an ordinary bolt using a grinder.  It's very handy for planing, sanding or any other reason you may want to clamp a piece down away from the edge of your bench.

"(Wife): Basic Paw Patroller. You must attach stickers yourself. There are also 1-2 other things you must attach / get in place before letting a kid play with this one. So, I unpackaged the thing and prepped it before giving it to our daughter for Christmas. Comes with Ryder figure and ATV. The ATV is pretty sturdy and good on carpet. But, Ryder's legs are rather fragile. The Patroller trailer section only holds THREE (3) medium-sized vehicles while closed. BUT, you CAN stuff an entire set of Paw Patrol figurines inside the Paw Patroller when closed IF you use figurines, racers and/or an appropriate combination of figurines and mid-sized vehicles. The cab of the truck holds 4-5 figurines. (Five if you really pack 'em in, possibly plus 1-2 removable packs. )

Here's what we stuff in our Patroller (while still being able to close it):

Two medium-sized vehicles with riding figures (Ryder & ATV, and Everest & snowmobile);
Two small racers (Chase and Zuma);
Two figurines plus their detachable packs (Skye and Rocky);
Two figurines with spring-action packs (Robodog and Tracker); and
Two figurines with other features (Rubble and Marshall). Reasonably sturdy Paw Patroller. Makes noise. Comes with battery. Rather large. Opens to reveal a second floor. Not bad for transporting or storing all Paw Patrol figures / vehicles IF you plan ahead. Our daughter enjoyed it for Christmas.",1

This is large enough for all but my mother's ""monster"" birds - but she has a rimmed cutting counter my dad built for her so that doesn't count, right? The well is wonderful, big enough to hold the drips from even a large well rested turkey - this has been a major problem with other boards we had, the side drains and wells were ineffective at best in keeping the mess on the board and not all over the counter, but this one works, no mess!  At least not on the counter.  It is pretty enough that I have used it as a serving tray three times so far, for a holiday beef roast, a ham, and two roast chickens, all looked lovely. and I didn't have to worry about drips damaging my table.  It is a nice tight grain, and washes easily - I applied cutting board oil twice prior to using and after each use and wash - no staining or cracking so far and I've had it just over a year.  It looks like it will last a long time.  Very happy so far, will report back if that changes but looks like a great purchase so far.",1

"RC kindly provided by the author in exchange for an honest review. Taming Alaska was amazing!! It was a thrilling page-turner with well-developed, witty characters. Cyn was one of the best female leads I've read. She wasn't afraid to speak her mind, went after her dreams (even if they were bad for her), and held her own in the Alaskan wilderness. There were times where the situation was gravely serious and she would have these thoughts that made you wonder about her depth, but then you realized that if you were in her situation you'd probably want to check some things off your bucket list too. Shane was perfect. He kept Cyn safe in some pretty harsh conditions, he was able to make light of a bad situation, while also being serious when he needed to be. Cyn and Shane together were everything. They just worked. But their story isn't finished yet. I can only assume there will be a sequel. And I. Cannot.",1

Cole is a biker with a conscience, he sees Angel in trouble at another club's party and feels the need to help her.  Poor Angel is just in the wrong place at the wrong time, her situation is bad and she is definitely saved from worse by Cole.

These two spend 9 days together, living, learning and having fun, until the floor drops out from under them.  Cole then has to decide what he wants to do with the rest of his life and Angel has to decide if she even wants Cole in hers anymore.

I think the book was well written and I liked the story line, it was a little slow from the get go, then the drama ensues.  It wasn't a gritty biker romance, but a good romance just the same.",1

"I almost loved these shoes...I do really like them.  My 3 year old has wide feet and he really likes slip on ""boat shoes"".  The problems with those shoes are they get stinky and he falls in them.  I looked at alllll the shoes on Amazon and these were my number one choice.  Visually I love the color combination.  The velcro strap fits great and the shoes are easy for him to put on and take off by himself.  He ran like a crazy man the first time he wore them and he was super excited that he didn't fall down!  I feel like much of the comfort comes from the width in addition to the general support provided from the shoe.  My only real complain is that after a week of so the shoes had little fuzzies from the material all over the gray part of the shoe.  I'm sure I could probably pick them off, but I don't have time for that.  They are still great as far a comfort and function, they just lost the new look a bit quicker than I anticipated.  I definitely recommend these shoes for anyone who has a kiddo with wide feet!
**This is my first New Balance purchase and I will definitely check out what they have available when purchasing his next pair of shoes**

Great characters, great chemistry between the H/h, excellent plots and twists. You won't be disappointed. My personal beef with books in this genre, is when the heroines are redundantly stupid and frustrating throughout the story. If you can get past that, you will definitely enjoy this series.

"While not perfect - this one is much better than the others we tried.  It is larger than the other ones tried and holds more soap = less filling.  It has an off switch which is wonderful when moving it or filling it.  There is a wheel on the side where you can adjust the amount of soap that comes out easily.  The only issue I have had is sometimes it takes 2 times of putting a hand under it in order to get the soap to come out.

"This is the second Yakima rack I've purchased and this one was for a trip from KY to GA via AL. First thing I noticed when it was delivered was the solid construction; it's heavy and solidly built. Assembly requires attaching the rack arm to the hitch with a single bolt washer/locking nut combo. Full assembly (on vehicle and ready to go) took around 15 minutes. Put two mountain bikes on and made the trip with no problems. On a factory receiver, the rack sticks out far enough to not be a problem scraping the bumper and swings out far enough to have zero problems with hatch clearance. At first, I didn't get the threaded bolt tight enough so it wobbled a bit, but on the return trip I tightened up a bit and there were no problems whatsoever. I wouldn't trust any brand other than Yakima.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the threaded hitch pin and space when loading 2 bikes.

Pros:
- Solid construction
- Swings down for hatch access
- Rubber straps secure bikes without harming paint

Cons:
- Tight fit for two bikes, but manageable
- Threaded bolt for receiver is not as easy to use as a standard hitch pin

Other Thoughts:
- Loading two bikes is tight. You can adjust where they sit (move the frame supports) to give you a little more room, but it's still a squeeze.
- With two bikes loaded, swinging the rack down/up in a controlled manner to get into the hatch is a little difficult.
- I will probably be buying a new washer/lock washer combo for the threaded hitch pin for added ease of mind, but the provided one(s) are sufficient and keep things in order.
- Be sure to securely fasten everything; things look like they might be bouncing around, but there is no worry of things popping loose--if it's secure, it's sturdy.
- A mid-sized crescent wrench or a 3/4"" socket will fasten this to your receiver. I recommend the socket as it was easier to work with.",1

"Ive decided to retire to Marietta and get a permanent ringside seat to all the excitement that seems to grace this little enchanting town. Bachelor auctions, hot cowboys, unsuspecting love weaving magic, and the essence of romance filling the air is just perfect, as these potpourri of authors create love stories around these wonderful people.

The second book in the Montana Born Brides brings out His Blushing Bride Piper Tierney even as Sebastian Bloom wants to fight his feelings for her. On a break from his doctorate program, Bastian comes to Marietta to attend his sisters wedding and ends up falling head over heals for the shy and blushing Piper.

Taking over from her father, Piper is the music teacher in Marietta High. Born with a birthmark on her face and having endured childhood teasing and bullying, Piper maybe a successful and beautiful, but her history with the opposite sex has a lot of learning to be done. And Sebastian charms her pants off and they fall into an affair that is supposed to be temporary or can Bastian convince Piper into becoming the next Marietta bride?

Dani Collins writes some really sweet love stories. I loved the fact that she gave her heroine a flaw that could happen to anyone. I admire the way she made Piper into this strong and independent woman, yet vulnerable and sensitive, wanting to be loved for who she is, a beauty inside out. And this beautiful lady sends Bastian into an emotional roller coaster as he tries to fathom his feeling for Piper and convince her of his love being genuine and permanent.

Another charming romance in the town of Marietta, and its always so very wonderful to revisit characters from the previous stories.

"Should really have been called ""The Men from UNCLE before they became the Men from UNCLE"" because this is actually the run-up period to the creation of the United Network Command for Law and Enforcement. So if you're hoping to see the UNCLE HQ and hear ""Open Channel D"" then you are going to be slightly disappointed.

Nevertheless this is a great film. The story is far superior to any James Bond movie and the characters are necessarily brought up-to-date (I saw an original TV episode and it was stunningly cheesy and out-dated). Some of the photography is highly innovative and there is a considerable injection of humor throughout the movie. Overall it had the right feel for a Man from UNCLE film without being ridiculously trapped in the past.

Cavill nails Napoleon Solo but Arnie Hammer struggles to reinvent the original Kuryakin character. Overall I'm okay with his performance but really there is no substitute for David McCallum. Truth is, his assignment was unenviable.

I'm not sure why this film didn't soar in the cinema - maybe too few of the younger generation are familiar with this long dead TV series. Anyhow, do yourself a favor and give it a chance. Especially if you like James Bond movies.",1
"but just couldn't do it. For reference, I bought the size 11 in navy blue, the size 11 in red and the size 11 in black. The navy blue is a darker color and the black is a lighter color. I wore them for about an hour and still have no complaints. They are great for lounging around in the house and on the beach. They are very comfortable and look great. I bought these for my husband. He loved them and they fit great. He is 5'10"", about 165lbs. He is 5'4"", 140lbs. He has had them for a couple months and they have been great. He said they are comfortable, but I would have given them 5 stars if I had not worn them. Very comfortable, it is a little narrow, but I have a very small chest. I have a large chest and it is tight, but not too tight. This is my second pair of this cute leggings. They are very comfortable and fit well. They are soft and comfortable. The color is exactly as I expected. Great, very comfy, I ordered size up as needed.

"So far so good! I have been using the darker moon light style Exo Terra bulbs for years and years with our 55 gallon tank for a 4-foot California King Snake. Unfortunately there must be a design flaw with them as they seem to blow out every 3-4 months or so and at $9/bulb it gets annoying!  The reviews on this said that they last for a long long time so I am hoping this really keeps going for a while!

I liked the darker blacklight style of the other one as it was dimly lit. This literally lights up the entire 55 gallon tank it is super bright and then lights up the floor around it. Pretty cool looking bulb and supposedly throw heat down towards the snake up to 16 inches. He seems to be more active when this light is on. Hopefully it does not harm him at all.",1

The sex scenes were scorching hot and I enjoyed the fact that Spencer and Levi were able to discuss their feelings for Chelsea with each other.

The shape of her face was probably the closest feature but overall I was disappointed because that is the main reason to buy this product. You child can make up a story on thier own and there are other free make you own story sites so the big hook was putting yourself in the story. I tried 2 of her friends, one with very distictive features and most family and friends could not guess which cartoon belonged to which kid. We decided to make a story with the best cartoon kid.

"Working great for over a week.  My installation is a bit different.  I am using it to activate a WEMO switch to turn on 100+ feet of LED cafe lights outside.  I have these in weather proof/resistant enclosures and have good outside WIFI due to an access point I have outside.  I had to drill a 1/2"" hole in the enclosure for the motion sensor to work.  It can not sense anything through plastic or glass.  A plastic bag was successful during testing, but not how I wanted to install it.  For additional weather proofing, I used silicon on areas prone to water intrusion.  To link the sensor to the WEMO switch, I just used IFTT(If this then that website)  and a simple rule mated them well.(If motion detected, then turn on wemo)

Works super.  Turns on lights as desired and sends IFTT alerts as well(though this is hit or miss it seems).

Also, this set up is working with Alexa(amazon echo) so I can say, ""Alexa, turn off cafe lights"" and she goes to work.

"After the preview it slows way down and nothing happens until about half way through.  Then the action picks up.  About half the narrative is devoted to the difficult connection and varying love interests of Kam.  She never really commits.  I'm surprised Seth wants a woman who is so unsure.

As detectives or spies, neither of them amount to much.  They cannot even trace a vehicle, though they seem to know this is possible.  And they go off half cocked and unprepared.  Even down into a mine without a map or a clue, followed by elves with guns.  The resolution, i.e. the identity of the bad guy, is contrived.  He doesn't exist in the plot until the end.  It wasn't terrible, I'd say OK.",1

"REALLY good for keeping my fitbit in its case! I can see where the FITBIT ONE'S case can eventually become loose!  So got these.  Why am I knocking off ONE star? FIRST BIG CON!!!! The price!  These are 7 SIMPLE silicone bands, yes.. you get a few, but really? $13.99???!!!!!  They must be making at least 95% or more profit on these. If I would have found anything comparable, I would have purchased them.  I can get whole cell phone silicone cases for my Samsung Note for $5 or $7 bucks on Amazon or eBay, these have much less silicone, and I could see $2.99 or even $7 (a dollar per band).

Only ONE is needed, not 2 as in the photo.  Holds nice and tight.  If you want to get out of it cheap (zero cost) you can use a rubber band I guess, but I wanted something that didn't quite look archaic. Wish they had some NEUTRAL colors, but not a big deal if your fitbit is hidden in a bra, pocket etc...

OTHER CON: if you take our fitbit out of the case a lot, these bands are TIGHT,and you have to wiggle and jiggle them off.  So it is one more thing to deal with.  I keep mine in the original silicone case, with one of these bands around it, and just pop it in a zippered wristband I got for it.  That wristband they send with the fitbit one really sucks (you lost the fitbit in bed after less than one week wearing it to bed!).  Get a zippered case and never have to remove the fitbit ONE from the silicone case again.

I purchased these on Amazon last week.  I like them, but the price is WHOLLY crazy for these. But did I pay it, YES, because I couldn't find anything like it.  So spent the money.",1

"I really wanted to like these as I read so many good reviews, and they look great when worn. First off, I have deeper eye sockets and always have had challenges finding goggles that don't leak.

After seating the goggle and tightening down with a firm, yet comfortable tension, these goggles didn't leak for about 500 yards. Then a small leak started, which i think was from the outer edge. Fortunately, the water didn't funnel directly into my eye, however it was a distraction. After pausing my swim, drying my face and goggles, and tightening things down even more, the goggle didn't leak for another 100-200 yards then water came in again. I tried several other times to reposition and tighten things, but this model just wouldn't work for me. Side note, I ended up with large raccoon eyes and a major headache from tightening things down for at least 24hrs after my swim. I probably should have conceded sooner :(

I hate giving a low rating as this product is very good quality for the price, and look fantastic, however it just isn't for all swimmers.",1

"Initially bough this kettle for use downstairs in our wet bar while guests were visiting.

Now with all the guests gone, we've brought it upstairs to replace our rusting Kitchen Aid stove-top kettle.

I love how quickly it heats, even when full, and is super handy when I want to quickly heat small amounts of water.

I've had no construction issues with the kettle in the 2 months we've owned it.

The one annoying design issue I had (which is more user err than anything) pertains to the location of the 'on' light.

I'd plugged the kettle in with the handle facing me and hit the on switch but saw nothing indicate it was on. I was like a monkey trying to figure out why the darn thing would turn on...then I realized the light was on the side of the kettle I could see.

'On' light should be by 'on/off' switch.

Overall, good product.",1

"Let me be blunt--Kowalski and Queenie were the only reason this movie gets four stars. Had it not been for their appeal as individuals and their chemistry as a couple...ish duo, I'd be giving this a three, instead. Sure, Eddie Redmayne was engaging, and Katherine Waterston was satisfactory. But the real magic--pardon the pun--rested with the performances by Alison Sudol and Dan Fogler. These two absolutely made the movie. Fogler was endearing and funny. Sudol was nuanced and magnetic. The final scene between these two--no spoilers--was my favorite part of this whole film.

And therein, I think, lies something of a problem.

Because this was supposed to be a movie about Newt. Newt and his beasts. Newt, and his beasts, and his friends. All of them fighting some dark force, as it so often goes in the wizarding world. And while this movie undoubtedly contained every one of those elements...I didn't care, At least, not as much as I expected to care with a film set in the Harry Potter Universe. Newt felt like an afterthought forced into a starring role. His animals played a very limited role in the climax of the story, despite being the stars of the title. And whole plotline surrounding the darkness they found themselves up against struck me as needlessly convoluted. In the end, I viewed this as less of a harrowing adventure film detailing the rise of Newt Scamander than a platform for enjoying the chemistry between a muggle named Kowalski and a witch named Queenie.

All in all, this film felt a little forced, largely unfocused, and--had it not been for the supporting cast--maybe unforgettable. But luckily, it has Kowalski and Queenie. So if you've got the money to spare, give it a shot for them. Or just Redbox it.",1
"I am probably not the most qualified person on Amazon to write a review on headphones/ear buds, but with that said, I LOVE THESE! Since my children are kleptomaniacs regarding anything electronic that Mom has, I only buy the super cheap headphones - the ones available at the gas station, costing $1-2. This cheapness keeps me from losing it when my earphones ""disappear"" several times a week. I was getting a few other things on Amazon and decided to try these. and guess what? THEY ARE AWESOME! I love how they cancel outside noise and kind of create a seal in your ears. I love how you can distinguish between '80s rock and classic country with these. (Most of the earphones I've had made Johnny Cash sound like Axl Rose. ) I am truly surprised at how clear these make music sound and how well I can actually understand podcasts and comedy now. It's like going from an 8-track to a CD - yep, there is that much of a difference. I am now a Gummy convert and will only use these. I have purchased an extra pair and I keep them well hidden. Bottom Line: These are fantastic ear buds, especially for the price. The incredible sound these provide make walking the dogs a true joy - allowing me to disappear into a cloud of loud, clear music, piped comfortably into the hearing holes on each side of my head. and keeps out the interruptions caused by a bunch of extraneous noise. You absolutely cannot go wrong with these - and their low price just elevates them to perfection.",1
"Maisie Dobbs just kept popping up on Amazon lists for months, so I though I'd try it. I was not as impressed as I had expected.  Maisie is able to slave all day as a maid and  read Kant at night.  i find it nearly impossible to believe.  Also, she combines a love of philosophy with psychology, but all her psychology seems not to have any of the sexist and other prejudices which were rampant at the time.  She has powerful friends.  In this book, everyone she meets becomes her friend, which is why it reminds people of Nancy Drew.  There's a lot of interesting history in the book, and its style and pacing are good.  Winspear is trying to make her Maisie a girl who can meet anyone, but that is the least credible part of the book.  Snobbery in England was a national obsession that took a hard blow with the Great War, but didn't die without a lot of other assalults.  At least Winspear references it, but these difficulties are too easily overcome by Maisie and her always right attitude and approach.  Some of the tips on how to make people talk seem odd to me.  Manipulative or new agey or just stuck in to explain why the most stiff  upper lip people would share their family secrets with Maisie.  I will probably read on or two more in the series, because this book had to introduce Maisie nd give her an adventure/mystery/plot to start off the series.  If I have to read about an anachonistic girl superdetective, I'm content with the Mary Russell series by Laurie King.  if i want post WWI mysteries, there is Charles Todd's amazing series.  And if you want old school writing by a woman who was contemporary with the whole WWI era, Dorothy Sayers Lord Peter Wimsey series are usuaaly in print.",1

"The Midwest caper is the first soft crate I've ever owned and I love it, I've used it at MANY dog shows and other events over the years.

The thing I don't like about the Midwest Camper is that it's very hard to wash out the inside and to drip dry.  It does not have bottom suports so you can't just hose off the inside and stand it up to dry.  My dogs get very muddy after swimming and having to wash out the camper was too much trouble.

"Prob the best cooler in its price range for weekend camping. Sturdy construction, with the lid being much more substantial than Thermos R-maid,or even Colemans own 48qt cooler.

The carabiner is kind of a pain to use.  I like it because it fits well in a pocket when I am not using it.  To be honest it is not much better than a cheap leash that costs 5 bucks.,1

This book is too researchy for the faint of heart.  I also found the premise of the story extremely interesting.  I liked how the characters seemed to have a great rapport with each other. ,0
It hurts me to give this a 3 star because it is a nice piece of equipment but it is a very small piece of equipment. The only reason I gave this a 4 star is because it is so small. I would have liked it a little bit longer. Great for the price. I have a 2 year old who can't move on his own so I needed a different style for him to use. I am very pleased with this product. I will be ordering another one for my 1 year old. I love these for our small apartment!Very nice and well made. I like that it is a little bigger than my other sheet. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it is not as thick as my previous sheets.,0

Overall, I'm very happy with this fan.",0
"I have been waiting for this book and am very excited for it. This is the first book in a series and the first I have read by this author. This book is packed full of action, suspense and romance.

I was given an ARC in exchange for an honest review.I was looking forward to reading the book, but the last part was so repetitive that I could not get into the book. I am glad I did.

The story itself was not very interesting, but I felt it needed a little more development. I am not a huge fan of the hero and heroine, but the book is mostly about the next chapter in the series. It is a fun little mystery that will keep you wanting to read more of the story.

I would recommend this book.I have read many of the author's books and I have never found myself wanting to give up on them. I found myself wanting more of the characters and their story. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to all.The story was great. ",0

"I received this tool as a gift. It is well made and very useful, especially with trim molding and almost anything that requires an angle on the sliding miter saw. However, the scale was misaligned by one full degree. I called Starrett and was told that their tolerance for this tool is +/- one degree. That is unacceptable from a company like Starrett renowned for their  precision. I exchanged the tool for another, hand selected from inventory, and found one just .1 degree misaligned after looking at a dozen or so. This is workable accuracy but IMO the tool should be engraved, and the scale should be accurate or the scale should be eliminated. The decal itself may be accurate but the application process seems to produce a fair number of these tools with misaligned scales. With a sliding miter saw this is not really a problem as you can just transfer the angle. But, if the scale is there it should be accurate or at least installed properly. With the scale accuracy problems it rates three stars. If the scale were properly installed and accurate, I would give it 5 stars. Then I would not have to use my engraved Starrett protractor to read the actual angle when needed.",1

Regretfully, The Painted Queen just doesn't cut it. It feels as if the characters are reading off a really bad script. It's painful to read. I finally resorted to just skimming, and I closed the book with relief at the end. There will always be a blank space on the shelf where this novel falls chronologically. I commend Joan Hess for trying; it was a difficult undertaking that would have been impossible for anyone to complete.",1

I want to like this, however, the sound box doesn't come out making it difficult to wash. There is a small seam that can be taken out and resewn, but I wouldn't want to do that each time I need to clean it. The sound quality is pretty good for this toy, but IMO, the music/singing isn't all that easy to understand. My one year old didn't play with it for more than a minute. However, every child is different so your child may get more use out of it.  We have other fabric books that don't have a sound box that rely more sensory objects like mirrors and textures that keep him engaged longer than this book did.",1

"Great for line-tending when watching ice divers!!! The divers in the water are always clipped to a thick line but a person needs to be holding that line to send 'pull signals', to pull them back, etc. The problem is that ice diving occurs in water just above freezing, definite winter conditions above the water. Wearing normal winter ski gloves doesn't work because they soak through with water as you grab the line; these don't get wet on the inside unless you let water run into them from the opening (hard to do, these have really long wrist areas and you don't tend to raise your hands up high too much while line-tending). Hands stayed warm from the fleecy material inside (I tested them at approximately -10F).

I admit I was disappointed in these gloves out of the box because the seams had rough edges where they were fused together - but as long as you're not rubbing delicate skin (or something) with the outside of the glove, it isn't a problem at all.

I also tried these for summer kayaking in Alaska because my hands always got cold from the cool water. Wearing these gloves was too hot. Sweat made them soaking wet inside since they don't breathe.

I laughed my head off that anyone would try these for Alaskan winters (aurora viewing/vacation). These won't help you at -40 temperatures. Buy real ski gloves (hopefully with a palm big enough to allow you to ball your hands up into a fist for finger warmth if needed) or mittens (the thick kind with waterproof covers).",1
I got this for my daughter and she loved it. We had fun putting it together. Good quality and we had some extra leftover Lego pieces from other builds so we were able to add to this item so she now has a unique Poe Dameron!!!,1
Such a fun toy! We got this for my daughter for her 5th birthday. She loves having a drill set and switching the drill's rotation to screw/unscrew. The case is really cute and I love that it holds everything and has a convenient handle. This offers lots of fun play time!,1

"So, this Augmented Reality thing sounded kind of gimmicky to me, but I was still curious and hey, the photo on the puzzle is pretty. It took me about a week to finish the puzzle in between a million other things I had to do. Most of it wasn't too terribly difficult - the hardest part was definitely the trees along the bottom. Took me as much time to do that almost as the rest of the puzzle.

At any rate, I downloaded the app and followed the instructions and it is kind of neat how the picture turns into a snowy landscape. My husband said, ""Oh, that's cool!"" But it wasn't an out-of-this-world experience for me. :-) I'm not sure that it was worth all the effort of putting the puzzle together if your only reason was to use the AR app. I don't think I'd go buy more of the AR puzzles unless I just really, really liked the picture.",1

"Brand new, the Spaulding 64-497 Official NBA Zi/O Excel indoor/outdoor basketball looks slick, and feels great in your hands.  The synthetic leather is very tacky, allowing someone with a medium sized hand, to palm the ball.  Along with a nice grip, the foam backing underneath gives the ball a cushiony feel, allowing for excellent control when dribbling.  This ball would be a very terrific choice for indoors , as the cushioning seems to make for a ball that is very responsive and lively.

With a softer outer layer, this ball doesnt fare quite as well outdoors.  Depending on the type of playing surface (concrete, asphalt), the ball can be a little less lively when dribbling.  Being sticky, it attracts dirt, and dust, and soon loses its tacky feel.  And playing on a hoop that has a steel net, probably isn't very healthy for the composite surface.

In conclusion, the Zi/O ball feels great, and would be ideal on an indoor court.  It can certainly be used outdoors, it probably won't hold up very well long term, under the more rugged conditions.  My choice for outdoors is&nbsp;, which is quite tough and very durable, Wilsons NCAA Indoor/Outdoor Tackified Synthetic Leather is also great, but seems to no longer be available.",1

"I received an ARC for an honest review. This was a great story and I love that I was able to read all 6 parts together. It would have been painful to have to wait in between!  The story was really involved with politics playing a major role and a tenuous treaty between shifters and humans hanging in the balance. Avelyn grew up in a school for girls dedicated to become mates for shifters. Each girl was assigned to a category of shifter, Fox, wolf, bear, Dragon, eagle. Evelyn was to be a Fox bride but she sabotaged herself by pretending to learn nothing and getting fat and failing interviews with prospective grooms. All she wanted was freedom. She was 3 months away from total freedom when Max Blackmane, Alpha werewolf, came to the school looking to buy a wife. Instead of a wolf bride, he chose the sassy Avelyn, who tried her best to fail,  even trying to run away. But they go to his home together where she feels trapped, unloved, frantic to leave. He is very patient with her and loves her spirit. But he hides something from her that may be his undoing and bring about the downfall of his clan. Evelyn cannot bear injustice and unfairness, so she will go against even her growing feelings for Max to see fairness done. Thus begins a time of terror for the Blackmane family, clan, surrounding villages, Europe, Avelyn's old school, possibly the world as they know it! Got you hooked?? Well, read the book! Besides, Max is hot and the heat between he and Avelyn is steamy! Great book!!",1

Set in LA and Las Vegas, TRUNK MUSIC gets the reader involved in Hollywood slease, police corruption and mob antics on the way to solving the murder of a man left in the trunk of his car (hence ""trunk music""). I am getting a bit tired with Harry Bosch getting in trouble with his police bosses and IAD (Internal Affairs Division) and his fellow detectives suspecting him of being a rogue cop. I mean, Harry has solved many murders brilliantly and, by now, they should be trusting him more. So it seems a little unrealistic that they still come down hard on him for doing his job. Perhaps Mr. Connelly will see the logical flaw in the plot there and correct that with different plot complications and tensions in future Harry Bosch books. I don't know but maybe I'll find out in the sixth Harry Bosch story, ANGELS FLIGHT. Such nit-picking aside, TRUNK MUSIC is music to my ears.",1

"The first fountain lasted less than 1 month. The cheap plastic part just broke off in my hand when I was cleaning the system for only the 3rd time. The cats, and I, were loving it up until then. After all, it was the prettiest fountain out there, plus it is mostly ceramic. My poor boy loved drinking from it! I had concerns because of all the bad reviews but was optimistic that I would have a good experience. I returned the first one to Petsmart, which is where I purchased it and decided to take a try on another one ... some of us take longer to learn than others! That one started leaking all over the floor after cleaning it for the first time when I had it for little more than 1 week. Yes, the nut on the bottom was tightened. Same experience a number of other reviewers wrote about. The water was no longer coming up through the top end of the fountain, instead started coming out the bottom. I was so disgusted I just through it in the box and drove it back to Petsmart. I will try one of the cheap ones now and see if it works. At least if it breaks, I won't feel like I got taken for a ride. I paid over $80 for this piece of garbage! LISTEN TO THE BAD REVIEWS!!!",1

"This 2002 film explores the world of Bob Crane, the TV star of Hogan's Heroes in the 60s.  Based on the true story of his addiction to videotaping himself in erotic encounters with hundreds of women, we watch his life spin out of control.  His two marriages fail. He can't get jobs in Hollywood anymore. And he's all alone.
Greg Kinnear stars as Bob Crane.  His performance is excellent for its depiction of the shallowness of the man.  And Willem Dafoe, as John Carpenter, his best friend who entices Crane into a wanton lifestyle, gives an outstanding performance.  Carpenter works for SONY and introduces Crane into the world of home video. He also brings him to strip clubs, sets Crane up with women, and flatters him incessantly.  Crane gets hooked into this lifestyle and this leads to an inevitable violent outcome.
The script is somewhat lacking but the actors still manage to get into the skin of the characters.  However, it makes these two men seem somewhat different from those around them and never captures the real whirl of the early 70s, when the freedom of the times was gripping America. Also, I wish that every woman depicted in the film didn't come off as a lightweight bimbo.
The DVD had some long extras about Bob Crane's murder.  This was the era before DNA testing and so, even though there was a trial, nothing was ever proved.  There were just too many questions.  And too many people who might have had a motive.
I enjoyed the film and the theme.  It held my interest and kept me watching.",1

"Great Cooler. Cheaper than other high end coolers, with what I consider better features. Extraordinarily robust construction, with secure yet easy to operate latches, and well through through double carrying handle options make this the nicest cooler I've ever owned.

Easy to drain (built with bottom at a very slight slope to drain---- and the train itself can be connected to a garden hose for remote draining. (well thought through product).

This 45 qt size is the largest size I could get that would still fit in the trunk of my Toyota Camry, but it's easier to keep in the back seat.  It's also just light enough for my wife and I to easily carry when fully loaded. Anything else would be too large and heavy for us.",1

Hated the story line. It was basically a string of cameo opportunities for Bollywood stars to show up. It tried to mix a serious story with too much light humor. Then it was scary. This movie couldn't make up its mind what genre it was. Don't waste your time.,1
"""Back and Back and Back Again,"" the movie's third act, which also features the first two episodes of the movie, is the most solid film in the genre, and it is especially effective with the five-star ratings.  The story is told in a rather simple and almost eerie way, with a great cast of characters and a good story.  The only problem is that the film is very short, with the first half of the film taking up most of the screen time.  The film is shot in a very small window, and the picture quality is quite poor.  There is a scene where a man is walking through the woods, and there is a scene where the sound of the woods is played to a loud and clear volume.  This is a very low-budget film, and it is likely that the story is not as good as the first film.  I don't know why the director was so reluctant to do this film.  The story is based on a true story of a man who, while in the woods with",0

Love this set!  It was for my grandson and he is crazy about it. He is 4 years old and begged me ( the sucker grandma Mum) to buy it for him. One criticism is that the tracks come apart easily which is a design feature perhaps the manufacturers could improve. My grandson is very adept at putting them back together.  It stays together better friending in the surface used as the setting. Still worth the purchase!!  My husband and I have enjoyed hours of fun with our grandson playing with this train.,1

So if you're out in the woods on a dark night, you have nothing.  Could be scary and even dangerous.  One note that can be either positive or negative is that the beam is pretty focused, more of a spot than a flood, so you can see far in advance.  I like it, so a positive for me.  Living in AK, I never go anywhere in the winter without a headlight.  Most of the time I only use the low beam, which is plenty to find my way around.  Also love the red light, which is a great one for going outside, has enough light to see where you are going, and still be able to see the stars or the Northern Lights without your eyes having to readjust.",1

"I loved this story from start to finish. Alana Ankh has created a whole new world that is filled with magic and is very compelling. When Ivy and Kris meet they are not supposed to have a connection to each other because they come from different races and have a different set of cultural norms however despite these superficial differences they can't stop thinking about each other. When Kris devises a way to get Ivy with him again it works and Ivy becomes Kris's concubine; flouting the wishes of his parents and breaking a betrothal. Ivy and Kris have a kind of whirlwind romance that has political repercussions for Kris. This story has love at first sight, fights both physical and verbal, societal pressure, and two men that fight through all of that nonsense to make a real life together.",1
"I bought this used off of EBay, but I would recommend this computer to anyone out there. The main reason that I say that is Apples are built to last, I don't mean the case or the screen or anything like that. What I mean is Apple does not make a bunch of different configurations of computers in the same year. There are two or three models out there a year and they are all priced over $1000, why, because they last.

In the past year I have upgraded this computer in three ways.

1. Went from 4GB RAM to 8GB RAM. Want to have a fast computer, just add RAM. I have never had an issue with that.
2. Upgraded the Hard Drive to a 120GB SSD, wanna talk about speed. 9 seconds from hitting the power to surfing the internet.
3. Removed the Super Drive and added a 1TB Hard Drive for storage. I don't know of an HP, Dell, Gateway, Acer, IBM or any of the other PC companies that you can do that with. (Admittedly once I got a Mac I never look anything up about a PC again).

As for performance, I have no complaints. There is nothing that I have attempted to do that I have had an issue with this computer. It seems with a PC that within a year some of the Software out there outperforms the specs on a computer that you just bought when you go down the PC route.

Here is what I would say to you. Sure you can buy a $300 PC from WalMart or somewhere, I bet that it might be in the trash or sold within two years.

I purchased a Dolica Proline at the same time as this one. So far it has been a better, more durable tripod (overall).

This one out-performs the Dolica if it's being used for shooting videos though.

First three chapters of the book are on hikikomori, which are also used to describe the book as a whole, but these chapters have absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the book. It is like two separate books in one.

They bounce very well, which my 1 year old demonstrated for us when she pull the container of water with the growing water beads in it, off the table!  water and bouncing bead all over!!  But, so fun to play with.  They are so relaxing.  Great for kids that need to use their hands, great sensory activity, and great way to reduce stress by just sticking your hand into a bowl of water beads.",1

My dog is still very nervous about the smell, but she's a bit less fearful of the plastic items on the floor.  She will probably just go outside with it, but it is nice to be able to clean out the mess before it gets to her.  I would definitely recommend this product.This is a great product.  My dog has a lot of hairball issues and it has stopped her from getting hairballs on her face.  It's well made and my dog is not crazy about it.

"This was an excellent novel with many threads of plot lines.  I felt the author did an excellent job not only in the writing of the story, but in the story itself.

The imagery was detailed without becoming tedious. You could picture the characters and the landscapes/buildings without becoming bogged down with pages & pages of description.

The mystery was well told without giving away early secrets. I was fooled until 3/4 of the way through, or more.

Believable, unpredictable, engaging, interesting",1

"These are really cool! We had a little glow party outside and the adults got to wear these while the kids had glow stick necklaces. Well, that didn't last long because the kids ended up with the earrings and the glow sticks! They glow really bright and look awesome on! They are clip on earrings, so even if you don't have your ears pierced you can join in the fun! These earrings glow for hours! The only issue I found with them was getting them to stay together at first. It took a bit for them to stay in the connectors to be able to wear them. These are tons of fun!! My daughter even ended up using them as a bracelet at one point! So much fun!

"I acknowledge, that I ordered these boots and others very quickly, as I got a great promotional price.

However, I did not realize that everything but the shoe part itself is quilted cloth! I honestly cannot believe it. However, it does say this in the written description. Also, the buckle is barely noticeable and it does not stand out at all. I had just ordered a Ralph-13 in pewter, and these are very different.

They do have a rugged sole that is good for walking in all kinds of weather. I have not worn them yet, but I have to say, I cannot personally see how the quilted fabric would be warmer than the material the shoe part is made of.

Honestly, these remind me of snow boots I may have worn as a kid. I definitely do not feel they are worth the money that is shown. I will keep them only because I got such fantastic deals on a number of boots.",1

I don't know enough about the frontier to know if any groups like this actually existed in America, and something in me is uncomfortable with the portrayal of any indigenous people groups as so sub-human.

He is always a bit stubborn with it and it has held up well.  I think it has held up well to a few pull ups.  I'm really pleased with it.This is a great product for dogs that need something to keep them occupied. I love that it is made in the USA. My dog has a lot of separation anxiety and this one has worked out great. It is a bit thick and doesn't take up a lot of room. It is easy to put on and it is comfortable for my dog. I have used it for a while now and it is very well made and very durable.Works great.Our dog loves them and is happy.My cats love these.  My dog is about 15 lbs.  He was very picky about his food so I would give this a try.  It's not a big deal and we feed our pets anything.  He eats it pretty much every day and it's a nice change of pace.  He has been eating it a lot and is enjoying the taste of it.  I'm sure he'll like it even more if he grows into a bigger dog.This is a nice little fountain, and the cats love it!  They love it too!

"I bought this (not on Amazon) to replace a Cuisinart CPT-180 which I moved to my 2nd home in FL, and still works well. I too bought it for the retro look (as I did the Cuisinart) but looks aren't everything. It toasts much slower than its predecessor. If I read an expert review right, the light/dark knob controls a timer rather than a toast sensor, which means no consistency between say white or wheat bread, etc.

On the plus side, I have used it for 18 months with no problems other than the slow toasting. And the slots will take large bagel halves. But I'm done with it. Ordering the Cuisinart CPT-180 today.",1

"Overall, I really love this item. My 10 month old loves it too. The best feature is of course the canopy. We wouldn't get to stay in the pool for as long as we do without the canopy. The sun can be so damaging, even with sunscreen on, so this allows me to not worry so much about that. The baby is 100% shaded when in this floaty, which is very important to me. We can stay in the pool for as long as we want and not worry about his sensitive skin getting burned. He sits comfortably in the mesh part where his legs go thru, and sometimes even leans backward in it like he's laying in a hammock! haha Personally, we don't use the blow-up octopus part on the front. We tried it at first but soon realized he had trouble seeing around it because he's still so small. So we replaced that. We chose to attach the toys to the sides where the canopy snaps on/off. He really loves the squeaky fish! The only other drawback is that when he's in the floaty, he can't actually reach the water with his hands to splash. He sits in the water but other than that, he can't reach it. So that is a bit of a bummer. But overall, we really love it and would recommended it. It is so cute too!",1

"I have mixed feelings about this book, the things that I liked were also the things that I didn't. Maddie for example, was this sweet girl-woman and throughout the book, it is revealed how much a victim this young girl really was. At the same time, I thought that is exactly what makes her such a complex character to read about. If this was reality, then I would not feel this way, because I think that her overcoming the abuse was so much a part of the story, it would be the furthest thing from entertaining for me to read. For this reason and a few others, one being the connection between Caden and Maddie that was choppy at times, I don't know if I would ever want to read this book again. There is definitely a difference  between the last two books by SM and the earlier ones in this series, one of the problems being that there have been huge breaks between books, and while I want to read a nicely finished book, this just caused me to forget and not care anymore.
I gave the book 4 stars because when Maddie and Caden were at odds with one another, it was written such that I really felt what they were struggling with and for that the author deserves credit. When they were reconciling, Caden showed absolutely the right amount of gentleness I wanted him too. Honestly,  the part where the conflict with his own family was not explained enough, I was  able to take at face value as I would not want to read pages and pages about the extremely violent circumstances of those times, a couple of sentences thrown in here and there were quite enough for me. All in all, a good addition to this series, but not a hot romance as I would like to have read from  SM.",1

"I've switched many of the bulbs in my home to LEDs but unfortunately there are still some fixtures to which there is no LED equivalent bulb for, such as the 100W incandescent ones. I chose Philips bulbs because they generally produce high quality bulbs and such is the case with this CFL, unfortunately one of the downsides of CFLs is that they take time to warm up. This bulb turns on and looks to be about 60% of maximum brightness for about a minute. The gradual increase in brightness is slow enough you don't actually notice it, but once the bulb is warm you can turn it off and back on and it goes back to 100% brightness. The color representation is good and it is slightly brighter than the equivalent 100W incandescent bulb while only using about 1/4 of the energy. Since the cost is about 1/8th of a 60W equivalent bulb it's a good value proposition. 3/5 stars because it's not perfect and form factor is slightly larger than a traditional bulb so it doesn't fit in fixtures that use lamp shade harps. If Philips could make the size slightly smaller and make the warm up time better I'd give it another star.",1

Started watching this on my Blue-Ray but found I could not reverse or speed forward. It just stops the movie. I notice that many commented how difficult it was to read the white-letter captions when foreign [ non-English ] words were being spoken but I did not find this to be a problem at all. It would have been nice to have closed captions for the English as well because of the pronunciation of the Spanish words.

The main problem I had was the issue of having to watch the entire movie without being able to reverse or speed forward.

I  will try it on my DVD player [ when I have access to it ] to see if the functions work better on a different device. This is the only reason it did not get five [5] stars. Otherwise.....

We have a 2 family house with access points on the 1st and 2nd floor, it is not an overly large house but try as I might I could not get a consistent signal in parts of the house with the built in LAN card on my Gateway laptop. I moved the routers, tried different antennas, downloaded updated drivers, even bought a new router for downstairs, but would only get 1 or 2 bars in the living room, with multiple drops. As a last resort I thought, why not disable the on board wireless and try a wireless card?

My laptop does not have a PCMCIA card slot, so I was limited to wireless express. This was the least expensive card I could find.

All I can say is, it works great. No drops, strong signal even outside. For me this was a great purchase. On my Vista laptop I did not have to install any software it used the Windows software and was a turnkey fix.",1

This flask is awesome. It took me a little bit to figure out where the shot glass was but after looking at the pictures on amazon i figured it out and quickly got the shot glass free from the flask. I love that the shot glass is collapsible you can this flask anywhere and have a shot. The flask is sturdy no leakage when tipped upside down which is a big plus. The shot glass fits perfectly on the side of the flask and comes off with ease. This is great for taking in the club with you instead of paying for outrageous drink prices slip this in your jacket pocket or purse and you have free drinks all night. Love the colors black and silver not to much but just the right beauty. All around this flask is great. Would make an excellent gift for fathers day or birthdays. I received this product for my honest review.,1
"DUDE. I think this is such a great steal for a knife like this. It came sharp, holds a nice edge, I love that it came with a lanyard, and the design is pretty freakin' sweet, as well. No regrets, I am happy I bought this as I am a collector of blades. It's a must have.",1

"This is an attractive crate.  It was easy to open and put together with just a positioning of rods and sliding of cover.  Huckleberry tried it out and discovered that the zippers are ""self-healing"" zippers which means that they can be pulled apart and then restored by sliding the tab and slider back over the separated parts of the zipper.  That is how Huckleberry ""opened"" the front door of the crate and met me in the living room when I returned home.  He did not damage the crate but it was disappointing.  Huckleberry is comfortable in his usual crate, a metal one, and goes in readily when I tell him I have to go to work so I was surprised that he tried, successfully, to escape from this crate.  We will have to work on training him to this crate to try to avoid such escapes when we are traveling.",1

"A Stairway to Danger is an intriguing novel filled with action and adventure from beginning to end. Tom and Will, two cousins living in a small town in the 1920s, become involved in a mystery when they find the body of the local deputy. Soon, they are investigating a mysterious barge on the river and becoming entangled in a dangerous adventure.

I found this novel to be reminiscent of the Hardy Boy series, except it is geared toward an older audience. The characters are well-thought out and realistic and the author gives the reader a good sense of the time period. Ben Woodard is an excellent writer who knows how to plot and plan a great adventure story.",1

It is not stiff like a lot of other brands I own.  The bag is light weight.  I love the color and the fact that the pockets are lined so you can carry your stuff in them.  I can't tell you how much I love the bag, but I do have to say that I have a hard time finding a bag that is actually ""stiff"" enough to be comfortable.

The sound is very clear.  I use it to listen to podcasts and listen to music with my iPhone and it is very loud and clear.  It has great bass and my iPhone does not have a volume control.  It is very comfortable to wear and have great sound.  I highly recommend these headphones.I've owned these for about a month now and have had no problems with them.  They do exactly what I wanted them to do.  They sound good and are easy to use. ,0
"I did return mine - I have all tile floors with room rugs, and being semi-retired and self-employed from home I spend a lot of time in my slippers walking on the tile. The original cork built-up soles on the OG clogs are perfect for this whereas when I wear this Charisma with it's soft thinner sole in comparison it SEEMS I can almost feel the floor though the sole. That means not enough support for wearing them 10-12 hours a day every day. DANG it I love them and they were only $42 from Warehouse Deals....I do wish they had worked out! If you like the look I would encourage you to try them out and see for yourself how they feel. As a general house slipper, especially on wall to wall padded carpeting and just light use in morning, evening and weekends I bet they'd be GREAT.

DETAILS: Charisma is unmistakably a slipper (as opposed to a clog that could be worn as a shoe). Charisma has a snug fit - the size 42 for women's size 11 had my toe pushing right up at the top. Bear in mind one of my feet is 10.5 and the other 11 - the 10.5 foot thought the length was perfect. The fabric is very soft with some give and they actually felt OK even with my toes nicely wrapped up - for the 10 minutes I tried.  Like the OG clog style, these do have the molded foot bed with the slightly built up arch support. They are nowhere near as tough and stiff as the OG clog style; the sole is thinner and more flexible especially at the toes which are not bulbous and padded as are the OG clog style. The bottom of these soles are covered in thin ""grips"" that mildly keep them from slipping on tile so I would say these are not for use outdoors - much.",1

I use a coping saw to rough cut my molding, and use this to get shave things down to a 1/32 of a inch.  It's too thick to hold like a pen, so I hold it like a paring knife.  The LEDs shine in my eyes so I had to block them with masking tape (there's no on/off).

Overall, it functions well. Although it has a couple disadvantages, these can be overcome with ""hacks. ""

ADVANTAGES:  It's easy to put the two halves together by matching tabs to slots. It has a hinged cover over the lock, unlike the Safety 1st which has just an opening. Once assembled, it generally prevents children from turning the doorknob while allowing adults to do so by simultaneously pressing the two ""levers"" on the sides and twisting. DISADVANTAGE #1: A child might be able to separate the two halves (although this item is more resistant to breakage than the Safety 1st covers). ""HACK"" #1: Use a strong glue (like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Henkel-01-82196-Loctite-2-Gram-Super-Glue-Gel/dp/B000ALBZGC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Henkel 01-82196 Loctite 2-Gram Super Glue Gel</a>) on the tabs to keep the cover intact (but not so much glue that you won't be able to remove the cover later!). DISADVANTAGE #2: On certain doorknobs, the rubber-like pads inside the cover might grip the knob too tightly, so that a child will be able to open the door with only moderate effort. ""HACK"" #2: Apply a small amount of silicone lubricant (like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10141WD-11oz-3-in-1-Pro-Lubricant-Silicone-Spray-Aerosol-Can-SHIP-GROUND-ONLY-ORM-D/dp/B000BBYCUC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10141WD 11oz 3-in-1 Pro Lubricant Silicone Spray Aerosol Can *SHIP GROUND ONLY* ORM-D</a>) to the pads inside.

"I absolutely love this Black Dome Tungsten Ring.  I wanted to get my hubby a wedding band that is different and unique.  I fell in love with this one, it is solid black and polished.  This ring looks so good and is made very well.

I got a size 9 which fits my hubby perfectly.  I have a ring sizer at home and this ring was sized exactly.  The ring is heavy for a normal ring, but that is expected from a tungsten ring.  He says it fits and rests comfortable on his finger.

Tungsten is a very hard and dense metal.  From the research that I have found, tungsten is ten times harder than 18k gold and four times harder than titanium and twice as hard as steel.  This ring is very durable and will last the test of time.  It has a nice polish and since he has been wearing it, the polish has held up really nicely.  He does a lot of hard labor and nothing has scratched it.

I completely recommend this ring.  I did receive this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.  This review is a 100% my own  opinion and I was not compensated in any way.",1

"Sports romance!! Woohoo!  A little different though since neither of them actually play! The quick of it...Okay so Jackson is a sports analyst and Leila...the new sideline sports reporter who's working under him. And oh the attraction and intrigue they have for each other! For the first time they've found someone who thinks like they do. It's numbers and stats and seeing how puzzles fit. One thing that won't fit? An office romance. *le sigh* And so a yummy battle of wills begins...

First up...Jackson. He's so yummy it's hard not to think naughty filthy things in his direction. Leila certainly had that trouble. And, well, he does too so double the fun for us! lol The connection between the two was great. I loved that they both have a thing for numbers and stats and think the same way.

Jackson's just flat out delicious. He's hot, sexy, at the top of his game, is a world class flirt and he's a good guy (sometimes he's a little too perfect) but he cares about people. I really loved the heroine too! She's a football junkie, a good person, hard worker and funny! I totally fell for her and her humor.

Their romance was slooooooow moving since they didn't want to risk her job at the network and whatnot but I loved that they became friends first and totally respected each other. But oh when it heated up! Oh, yeah! It seriously heated up. There were sweet and aw-worthy moments between them too that totally had me in a swoon. Oh, and he's got some growly alpha male in him too so it's not ALL sugary sweet...

Of course there was a little bit of relationship drama. I didn't totally buy into the reasoning behind it--it was a little shaky to me--but overall I was still on board.

*dreamy sigh* Jackson's Trust was a deliciously fluffy treat. A fun romance, wonderful friendships, humor, heat and plain ol likeable characters made for a delightful time.",1

"I use this projector for a number of reasons, which I will list below.

1. It's small enough to fit in a pocket, or if you don't mind having to carry it around when not in use, it's plenty compact.
2. It's compact enough to fit in a backpack, or if you don't mind having to carry it around when not in use, it's plenty compact.
3. The sound quality is decent, and not overly loud, but I would prefer a little more bass, but I'm not sure that's a deal breaker.

The only real issue I have with it is the volume. It's a bit loud, but I would prefer to have it at 1/2 the volume.

Overall, it's a great projector, and the only thing I don't like about it is that it's not quite as bright as the HDTV that I have. It's not the brightest color, but that's not a big deal for me, but it's a big deal for me.

"If you believe in raising your child to be a ""free spirit"" who can be disrespectful and poorly mannered, then don't buy this book. However, if you are a parent who wants to raise a child you can be proud of, then this is a great read. It follows the authors personal experience with raising his three daughters. Unfortunately many parents today can't be bothered teaching and modeling values and positive personal characteristics to their children. Hence, the rise in children living on the edge, crime, disrespect and just plain old poor behavior. As an educator, it is refreshing to read about a dad who sets standards of behavior. You get what you expect and what you allow you teach. I would recommend this book to parents who want to mould their children to be responsible citizens.",1

"UPDATE #2: As promised, the vendor sent a replacement headset, which does seem to work better. I was also surprised to find this one fits better too as I did NOT expect that. The original headset seems to be too springy (not really a great way to describe it, but the best words I can come up with at the moment), so it is constantly pulling at my ears and coming loose even with slight movement. This one seems to a little loser, so it is more forgiving of head movement. SO, headset #2 seems to have addressed my two biggest complaints about the headset, so I am happy to upgrade the rating to 4 stars instead of the original 1 star rate. Kudos to Patozon for taking the time to make things right!

UPDATE: The vendor has reached out to me after this review and they are sending me a replacement headset which I think is awesome. I have bumped this up to a two stat based on the customer service. Once I get the headset, assuming there is improvement in their performance, maybe I can bump it up even higher.

I am surprised this headset is so highly rated. I find them to not fit very well and they are constantly falling out of my ears even with the proper ear piece size. That alone would not justify the 1 star rating, but combined with the low sound quality and awful Bluetooth connection, this headset is a huge disappointment. Using a Samsung Galaxy S6, any audio streamed to this device is choppy, in many cases beyond comprehension, unless the phone is about 2 inches from the heaset; even then, sometimes it still doesn't work. I do not have this same issue with other Bluetooth devices paired to this phone. Given the primary function of a headset is to play audio and the fact that this headset doesn't seem to be able to do so warrants a 1 star rating. Wish I knew why some many others have a different experience with this product.",1

This is still a good investment.  I'm not sure how I could get better than this!  I think the quality of this is just great.  I highly recommend it!I am returning this product.

It's a little hard to pull off the metal rod because the plastic tip keeps getting stuck on the rod.  I have had it for a month and it still works well.  It's not very durable and the fabric is not thick enough to hold the rod securely.  The inside of the rod is very tight.  The rod is now a little too long and the plastic tip is now more likely to get stuck on the rod.  I have also had it for a month and it still works well.  I had to return it because of that.

"I've been using this tablet for about a year. It's a good tablet for the price.  There are three problems that may affect your purchase. It does not have enough disk space. I use it mainly to read newspapers, surf the web, read email and play one game. I have Office installed. No other software yet there isn't enough space for updates.  The second problem is battery life. This says 6 hours. Maybe on standby but if you are using the tablet, expect that you'll only get 2-3 hours. Lastly the keyboard is awful. I do not have large hands but the keys are so small that I'm constantly deleting text or bringing up a pop up menu.

"This came just in time to try! My daughter and I just baked a cake for my husband's birthday and the door bell rang with this delivery! I opened the box to find a well crafted cooling rack.  I had an older model drying rack that rusted and frankly was junk. I am pleased that this is made of stainless steel.  It is plenty wide enough to hold two round cake tiers without issue.  It has ample spacing to allow air to the cake, but are close enough to not damage our cake.  Best of all, the cakes removed easily and did not stick at all to the drying rack.  The raised legs allowed the air to circulate around the cakes.  Clean up was equal awesome! I rinsed in the sink, since there was really no cake on it and left in the drying rack. It dried sparkling clean. The cooling rack is also smooth. I ran my hands over it to ensure there was not any defects and to my pleasure, it was completely smooth.  I am so happy this came today and would definitely recommend the purchase to anyone who enjoys baking.

"Two of Jack Nicholson's best ever tantrum scenes
If you've seen this movie, you probably know what I'm talking about. There's one scene in which Nicholson REALLY doesn't want to invite his ditsy girlfriend (Karen Black) to come along to the family home to visit his dying father - and when he realizes he can't get out of it, he sits in his car and comes unglued. Then he get out, goes back inside and very calmly says, ""Rayette, you wanna come with me?""
The other one is in a roadside caf when the laconic waitress won't alter the menu selections by one jot - and again he comes unglued as only Nicholson can do when he's at the top of his performance, which he usually is.
But the rest of this movie is dark, dark, dark - a mood piece of a dysfunctional family. Nicholson plays a wounded outcast, a former piano prodigy who has been estranged from his father for years, spending his time as an oil worker in Texas, shacking up with his annoying girlfriend. When he learns his father is dying in Washington State, he sets off for 'home.' Most of the rest of the film is an odyssey, a road trip back to the family mansion and all he's left behind: his attachments, his family, his problems, his fears, and his failures.

We collect a lot of this stuff and the kids love it.  This is a great stocking stuffer.My grandson is 9 months old and loves the game of chess.  This is a great toy for him.  I would recommend it.This was a gift for my daughter.  She loves it!  I did get a free item and it is a great gift.We love this set.

"I upgraded my desktop computer because the video card I was using was considerably outdated, and I couldn't even burn DVDs because it was so old. I wanted something inexpensive, but powerful enough to run most video applications. This card integrated perfectly with my computer, even though I only have a X-press 1.0 slot instead of a 2.0. I tested it on YouTube with an HD (1080) video running full resolution and full-screen the quality was flawless; the only lag and jitter was from my Internet connection. The GPU even works with BOINC and helps my computer crunch data. A great card for a wonderful price.",1

"My husband and I both enjoy this game. It is a great learning tool for the kids and we have so many fun games. The game is easy to understand, the rules are easy to follow and the cards are easy to understand. The game is also very easy to play. The game is a bit difficult for younger children because they can't learn the rules by themselves. It also makes it very difficult for older children to understand what is going on. Overall, I would recommend this game for any child who is interested in learning.Perfect for my son's classroom.  He loves to play with it and plays with it all the time.  It's great that he can play with it and enjoy it and to learn from it.This is a cute little plush.  It is a good size and the little pieces fit together really well.  My daughter loves it.  I love that it is a little small but I think it is a good size for little ones.  My daughter is 4 and she likes to take her time with it and it keeps her busy.  I would recommend this toy.  I will be buying more of these as she grows.This is a great puzzle for a good price! My son loves it, he also loves the colors and the details. It is really cute.

"I read this book and I really enjoyed it. A poignant, memorable, sad, moving and touching story of one of the most tragic events in the state of CT. I enjoyed all the old pictures, the stories, and the memories in this book about the fire. It told of the aftermath also. It was well written and Mr O' NAN spend a lot of time researching material for this great book. If anyone wants to read about this event, then this is the book for you. I bought this in hardcover also for keeps. I enjoyed this book immensely since I am a history buff. It also told about Little Miss 1565, and the trial. Mr. O'Nan goes into great depth about this subject making it easy to understand.",1

"So I like big desks with lots of spots to organize your things on. My wife hated my previous desk, which was big with lots of organizing space. She thought it was ugly, but it was the only desk I could find that suited my needs in that exact way. Then I found a desk set that wowed both me and my wife. This credenza made a great extension of that desk set.

It's a simple design, but that belies the great functional details and style this desk offers you. The desk top is a good size with a nice slick finish that will make the room you have it in look better just by being there. The desk has some heft to it, but not so much where you cannot move it around. On top of the desk is a central opening with a cover for cables to come through. Under the desk is a nice cable management system going all across the center of the back board that ends next to holes in the side boards for you to run cable without hitting the ground. All in all a nice way to organize your cords.

The desk is not made of solid wood. If it were I would be worried as good solid wood furniture doesn't come cheap. What you do have is a nice, thick, layered particle board desk that is a good deal sturdier than what you normally find. Installation is pretty easy, but it is tedious if you don't have power tools. A Philips head screwdriver and maybe a hammer is all you need.

This credenza was used as an extension for a larger desk set I put together. You can do the same as this particular collection is very customizable. As a basic desk all on its own it makes for a good, solid worktable. I would recommend a hutch from the same collection to get the most out of it.",1
"We've been really lucky that this has kept the dogs in good health. They have been pretty healthy since we started using it. We also get the Toothed Rabbit and other treats that aren't so much in the bag, but can be easily thrown around. The cats also love it. They love the taste, too. I think it's a great deal. We got this for our dog to use as an on/off leash. It works great on him. He is a chewer. He's a medium-size dog and he loves this collar. It's easy to put on, holds the dog well, and is easy to use. It's well made and has a nice handle to hold the dog's head. I was able to find some of the sizing information on the package, but my dog doesn't seem to mind it. I'm not sure if it's a good idea to change the sizing information, but it's just good enough. I'm very happy with it. I would recommend this collar to anyone with a dog who is a chewer or chewer and/or chewer.",0

"This retractable leash is the perfect size and quality. I will definitely be buying this again. Great product. Great price. I am a small dog, and this collar is very large. It is very easy to put on, and it is adjustable. I ordered two for my two small dogs, one medium and one large. The medium one is a little longer than the large one, but it fits perfectly. The small one is a little bigger than the medium one, but it is perfect for me. I am very happy with this purchase. I have a 15 pound Yorkie mix. She is a bit smaller than most dogs, but she is still a little bit on the small side, so I thought she would be fine. She's a bit bigger than most dogs, but she is still a little on the small side. I wish it had a small collar, but I don't think I will buy it again.",0

"I was given this book as a Christmas gift, and I read it in a couple of hours.  Albom presents a ""heaven"" without a God and without joy.  I found it trite and depressing.  As far as I can figure, Albom thinks heaven is a way to create closure and explanation for one's life that is not possible in this life.  That makes far too little of both heaven and life on earth.  If you are at all introspective or a believer in any kind of loving god, this book won't get you any farther along the road.",1

My cats have a misguided sense of smell. I've tried a lot of different foods and they will all tell you about the difference. My cats are not the same as other cat owners. They are in a phase of being lazy. This is a great food for them and a great place to look out for them. I have tried several different brands and none of them were great. I highly recommend this food. I have a 60lb terrier mix and this is his favorite food. My dog absolutely loves this bed. She loves to sit on it and it's a great size. It fits nicely in her crate and she's not afraid of anything. It's a nice small bed for her to sleep on.,0

"After a good charge, I noticed a noticeable difference in the pressure of the bat. I ran the bat twice a day and it hit a solid 32 FPS, and the bat was very stable.

The bat is a good value, and it's going to last a long time. I haven't used it with a single bat, but I'll try it with a single bat once. I just can't imagine using it with a single bat, because it will feel very weak.

I've also purchased a few others. I've only used one bat, but I'm very happy with it. It's definitely a good value, and I can't imagine spending a lot more money on one.

The bat has a nice handle, and the handle is very comfortable. I've used it with a stick, and it doesn't seem to be that bad. I'll probably only buy one more bat from this company, as it's pretty pricey. I'm going to try and purchase another one at some point.I'm always looking for a lightweight shirt to wear when riding my bike. This one is exactly what I was looking for.

"As an individual who has dealt with a small cup size all my life, I am used to disappointment when purchasing bras. Even more so now that I have gained weight, and can't even find my size in a store. So, despite the glowing reviews of this bra, I was prepared for yet another bra with puckered, too-large cups, and an uncomfortable band. Surprise! It fits and is extremely comfortable. Somehow, even though the sizing for 2X seems to indicate a C cup, (or above) the bra manages to both to fit and flatter my B-  sizing. And though the band in front does tend to wrinkle/fold over a little, I don't care. A bra that flatters and is comfortable is rare, and I am purchasing more.",1

It's very easy to put on and it seems to really help with his teeth. I have a vet who makes a lot of money and does a great job on dog teeth. I am very pleased with this product and will continue to purchase it. I would recommend this product for anyone with a dog with a sensitive tooth. I have used this for about a year and it still works. My dog is a big chewer and I thought this would be a good toy for him. Unfortunately, he was just too big for my 18 pound dog. I took it to the vet and he told me that he had found a new toy that was very different and I was worried that it was not a toy he would be able to play with. I took it back and it is a great toy for him. He loves it. He has a very picky eater and will eat anything and anything. I love that it is made in the USA. My dog loves this toy.

I purchased the MM 520 because it seemed like a reputable company one year ago.  I was so wrong.  from the day of purchase nothing but problems.  This things been out of commission over 8 months out of a year I had it.  Every time I call them they make you test everything.  It's a good thing I know how to use an electric meter and have one around. After going through loops every single time they want the board sent back to them.  On the phone they tell you they will get one sent back to me in 5 days but it always takes about a month. Their constant excuses is they are under staffed.....  last time I had issue was due to constant beeping.  They wanted me to send back the unit back to get me another master board. well they sent me one but it did not work.  Then they wanted me to send them the arm and the board which I did.  Called them after three weeks of waiting and they tell me there is no board that came with the arm.  WHAT??????  So finally got it back after two months and it had a slave board instead of the master board.  that's not all. I get a package from them about a month ago with someone else control board and battery.  I have never dealt with such unknowledgeable support and disorganized company in my life.  What a joke.  DO NOT buy this product or any other product from this company.  Unless you enjoy paying over a grand for the product and accessories so you can open the gate by hand 70% of the time.

I ended up taking a sharp knife with a fine point and kind of carved away at the opening to make it just a bit bigger.

"I've always been a sucker for a bad boy who comes back to a town from his youth and tries to makes up for past mistakes! This is such a book. But I have to say I really felt a strong connection to the hero, Luke. I've read several of these types of stories before and liked the main characters but Luke has to be among my all-time favorites! He just seemed real and fallible and I loved how the author didn't make him too macho in the beginning or too sappy at the end! I loved his humility and his desire to ""do the right thing"" as situations arose even when other people in the community questioned his decisions. Luke comes back to town to be the interim sheriff and Holly cannot believe it! Luke almost destroyed her family, mostly her father, who is the current sheriff, when they were teenagers and she can't forgive Luke for that. Why is her father giving his job to Luke? Holly has so much on her plate, namely a young son who is getting in so much trouble, a father who she doesn't understand, a business that is stressing her out and she's a widow! Her town is falling apart and now Luke is back in town after a decade away - WHY???? Luke, on the other hand, was the child of the town drunk, and he knows people are not going to accept him until he shows them he's not like his father.

"Fantastic scandalous read!  Sam and Nick are trying to keep it real in light of his new ""promotion"". Co-workers, friends and family are excited to help them on their journeys. But, an early morning New Year's Day murder threatens to bring Sam's inner circle to their knees. As they close ranks to find the killer, leaks to the media make it all the more personal to Sam.

Nick starts his first day as VP wondering what role the administration really wants him to play. He's feeling a bit left in the dark. He is resenting being used to boost the President's approval rating.

Scotty is becoming more entrenched in the lives of Sam and Nick.  They can't imagine their lives without one another. But, what will happen when something threatens the adoption?

"I bought it in hopes that if I mounted it to a backyard faucet that it would stop the hammering sound/shake of the refrigerators icemaker inlet tube, caused by new innards, from one of the toilets. It did !! Of course, I had to add an additional on/off valve, from the hardware store, to it. And of course leave the original backyard faucet valve turned on.

Why would I do this? I didn't feel comfortable attaching one at the toilet's inlet tube, which would be more appropriate (different model with different fittings).",1

"Jamie Blanks' 2001 ""Valentine"" is a real standout.  The film is a turn-based action adventure.  There are a few twists, but the movie is very action-oriented.  The action sequences are well done.  Some of the special effects are very good.  The special effects are a bit too intense.  Overall, ""Valentine"" is a solid movie.  I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys action and adventure.I like this movie very much.  I have watched it about 1,000 times, and I am not sure how many times it has been viewed by other people.  This movie was a good introduction to my daily routine.  I had some problems with the writing, but I thought it was good.  It's a good movie for a young person to watch.  I have no problems with the sound.  I just wish they had used some audio or video capture techniques.  It was good to see some of the actors in the movie.  The acting was good, and the characters were believable",0

"Another great book of Katie and Tyler's love story. They are finally back together again and living together in California. Trouble finished their European tour and Katie and Tyler talked all the time and skyped every night. Now that they are back together again and more in love, things are going to take work and nothing worth anything will be easy. More secrets are revealed and they both have to live with mistakes they made and things that happened.

Katie hasn't always been Ms. Responsible or Ms. Perfect. She's lived her life and made some mistakes but she's never done anything intentionally to hurt anyone. She has a good heart and she cares about the people in her life. Her love for Tyler is all encompassing and she just wants to make him happy.

Tyler has a really screwed up past and he's had problems for years of trying to get past it all. He's done so many drugs and almost died on many occasions. But his love for Katie makes him want to be clean and have a life with her. He's trying to find a way to work where his problems with his hands don't interfere.

Definitely worth reading and looking forward to more of their story that comes out in January.",1

Why did Mattie want to be Englisch???  This wonderful story answers the question.  Mattie's need to get away was so painful for her.  She seemed to be rebellious because how her father treated her.

Does she find herself???  Will she succeed in the Englischer world???  You need to read this story to find out.  I loved it and found it an eye opening read regarding rebellion.

That was horrible.  So I'm back to this one again, and we can connect them all together to form a huge marble run. We're having a lot of fun with this.

Her long brown hair is down, with a little bit of wave and it frames her face, making the perfect window. "" ~Courtney Pierce

Through the first two books comes together to bring in Court's POV and you will find out what happened between him and Annabella and things will come to light between Court and Rachel. Break Me ended in a small cliffy to start this book up with Rachel finding out she is pregnant. Is it Kellan's or someone's else?  No spoilers here so you will just have to see. I really loved this book and finding out more info on Ashley, Victor, Annabella and several unexpected twists to be revealed. Of course, you will have plenty of swoon worthy moments and angst to hold you over. Don't forget about the betrayal and enough steamy scenes to make up for it. I love this series!

We're raising a very high energy boxer puppy so this is a blessing!  At first Bubba kept kicking it and hitting it with his feet he didn't get it, but after some ""positive praise"" each time he used his tongue instead of his feet he got the idea - now it stays nicely on the floor and he doesn't kick it - he just spends a good 15-30 minutes licking away till he laps up all his kernels! :) Thank you for designing this!",1

"I have to agree with the above posters. When I saw the price for these I cringed but my hearing is more important than 50 bucks so I ordered these and slapped them on. Yes, they are really great, no more gaps that let in unwanted sound when I turn my head. Only thing that makes me a tad upset is why the heck didn't these come with these sealing rings on them already.

My brother bought a pair of Howard Leight R-01526 Impact Sport Electronic Earmuffs and I tried them on and the earcups have a lot of gaps that let in sound and don't even have the option to upgrade the cups 8(, Pretty sad when those earmuffs cost $50.

"I have pops of teal and blue, as my accent colors, in my home, so was really happy to come across this piece. It comes with a lightweight wood tray, which can either be used with the tealights, or with something else. Their are 9 tealight holders, in the set, of varying heights, colors and textures. The great thing is, since there are 9 tealight holders, you could actually break them up and use some in other areas too. Also, you could either use real tealight candles, or you could do like I did, and order a battery operated set, with timers, also found on Amazon, and place those inside, so they would come on automatically every night, and then all you have to do is periodically change the batteries. These tealight holders are also great on a window, where they catch the light. If you have a bathroom with a tub, by they window, they would be great on the window ledge, where they would catch the light, during the day, and could be used for ambiance, when taking a bath.",1

"Mounted this on the stem of a Schwinn Excursion bike.  Easy to install with the provided O-Rings.  Wireless sensor mounted easily as well with its own O ring.  The spoke magnet was a little tricky to install but once I had it oriented the right way (directions are not crystal clear) it went off without a hitch.  The wheel sensor has a little green led that flashes when it detects the magnet so you can test the distance between magnet and sensor to make sure its correct and working.

The display comes setup for handle bar mounting but instructions are clear and simple if you need to change its orientation on the base plate for stem mounting.  The computer twists off the base plate so you can pocket it and walk away when leaving the bike locked up in a  dicey area.  The instruction book comes with a tire chart so you can set tire size without having to measure anything.

Keep in mind that the display never actually turns off; when it detects no activity for a while (15? minutes) it switches to standby mode and just shows computer model number.  Even with that the battery (CR2032) is said to last a year in both the computer and speed sensor so we will see.

The instruction booklet is a little dense as every page repeats the instruction in 5 or 6 languages but fairly simple to follow.",1

"I bought two of the Sugar Puppy Surprises, one for my 2 1/2 year old daughter and one for my 6 year old niece, for Christmas and they love them and haven't put them down! I had one as a kid and was thrilled when I saw they were remaking these and kept the look of the ones from 20 years ago instead of revamping the look like they do with all the remake toys. Sugar has very soft fur and I love the sparkly strands throughout her purple hair. The stitching on the dog is very well done and it seems durable.

Both of mine had 5 puppies so we were excited about that. Each puppy has a hard vinyl head with a soft body and a pink or blue bow around it's neck to determine if its a girl or boy. The puppies are about 4"" long and Sugar is about 15"" long. My niece's actually had a preemie puppy which was really cool! She was excited that there was a runt in the litter that was slightly smaller than the rest. I do wish the stomach hole in Sugar was a little deeper to accommodate all the puppies a little better but they do fit back in though it's a tight fit. They are very expensive on here and can be found cheaper at Target or Toys R Us. Simple but very fun toy and hands down their favorite gift this year!",1

It was not meant to be high art, so I'm rating it for delivering a good job for what it was intended to be:  a cute and well written story about 3 nice and likeable Texas girls, mostly set in wonderful, romantic European settings, and just a lot of fun overall.  All three actresses were quite good and this was a nice afternoon escape film. It was nice to see a teen film that was pretty positive and wholesome for a change, not too old for its intended audience.

"What makes Ellis' work so compelling is the fact that he is a writer who is both a master and a self-proclaimed ""person of the year.""  He has created a fictional universe that is both realistic and realistic in its historical details.  Ellis' characters are still real and full of emotion.  And because of the fact that Ellis has created a fictional universe that is both realistic and realistic in its historical details, it is not an easy task.

My only complaint is that the book does not have a lot of action, and the ending is not very satisfying.  There are some scenes where Ellis is trying to explain to the reader the story of the Holocaust, but this is very much a minor gripe.  Ellis is also very clear about his feelings towards the Holocaust, but it is very much a minor gripe.  I don't know why it is",0
Good show.  Did not find it entertaining.  Not for children.  Would not recommend.,0

"If I remember correctly, this product has many great reviews which encouraged me to buy it. I love that it's made with wood and will last a long time. My four year old is very interested in it and we have attempted to play with it several times. The felt puzzle pieces that create the roads come apart very easily. This causes many problems as one begins to construct the city unless you are very delicate. The city itself must be built on a flat surface, so no carpet. This is very challenging with my two year old around. Even if she wasn't there to knock things over, it seems like it would be difficult to play with the city once set up. It is not designed to be very sturdy.",1

"Like any film instructor, I'm always seeking an affordable text for my students. With the average text hovering around $80.00 (and then the additional charge for supplemental books), The Lean Forward Moment seemed like a steal. I say ""seemed"" because like many reviewers here, I'm a bit confused as to whom the target-audience is.

The simple, jargon-free language appeals to the lay-person (which is always welcome in texts geared toward the masses); however, the structure and more advanced concepts give the feel of an academic text. The Lean Forward Moment seems stuck in a perplexing gray-zone. While I feel Hollyn was attempting to please both audiences, he may have (accidentally) alienated both. Curious.

I know that it seems superficial, but one of the ways I evaluate the potential success of a film-text, is through its examples. I know (for a fact) that my students excitedly scan a text ... looking for stills from works they know/love. The Lean Forward moment uses many popular (and technically masterful) examples. The Matrix, Finding Nemo, 300, Lord of the Rings, The Godfather -- all good choices to get the cinema-neonate involved. On the flip side, Across the Universe, Brazil, Synecdoche, Contempt, Coons, Jack in the Box, Satacracy 88 -- these niche/obscure works are interesting to more advanced students (maybe). (And, now we're back to that gray-zone ...).

Here's my professional opinion, The Lean Forward Moment is fantastic for the intermediate student who knows the fundamentals, will be entertained by familiar examples, and is curious about lesser known works.",1

"My cats loved this product. I used Instinct food for them prior to starting to make my own food two years ago. Originally, I had purchased the rabbit treats until one kitty developed a rash under his chin. Okay, switched to chicken. First cat's problem went away. Then a second cat developed LUMPS under her chin. Not a rash, lumps. Lumps were surgically removed, pathology done, results were; ""typical with an allergic reaction."" As the only other item that ever crosses their lips were these treats, the vet zeroed in on the treats as the culprit. (My food is made from chicken thighs, livers, gizzards and hearts, all human grade, from the human food case at the store.) In hindsight I should have known better after the first kittie's reaction...this has been a very expensive error on my part. The rest of my cats (there are 11) showed no outward reactions. They have consumed the treats on an off for for over a year. No idea if something in the product changed, or if my furchildren grew resistant to the product's ingredients. If you use this product, Keep a close watch on your kittie's chin!!",1

"In this film, which had been an award-winning film for a long time, the director has to explain that the film is not a typical film, but rather a tribute to the late director, Christopher Walken.

In a way, the film is an excellent tribute to Walken and his work.

The most remarkable thing about the film is that the director has chosen a different ending for the film.

This is a very good film that is very realistic.

I highly recommend it.

Kudos to the director for taking this film seriously.

"These cheater plugs are great. I ended up buying these cheater plugs because I needed a pair of earrings that I can wear daily and won't poke me in the neck or fall out because of a cheap backing. These earrings fit all of my requirements; they have a nice screw-on back and they are identical front and back so no more neck poking. These cheaters do look like the real thing as well. They fit well and I forget I'm wearing them because they are so comfortable. These are made of surgical steel and feel very well made and seem as though they will hold up well over daily use.

It is important to note that the posts on these are larger than the average stud post so you may have to work to get them in the first time around. Normal earring posts are usually 18g these are 16g.

Edit: After being so pleased with these cheaters I went ahead and purchase this same style in the other colors (black, purple, blue, green and the plain silver ones) I love all of them just as much as my this rose gold one. The colors are all true to the pictures and they all are well made. One thing I should mention is the plain silver pair has a slightly longer post than the rest but it doesn't really bother me.

Since I cannot add reviews for the other ones on their respective pages I will just add the pictures of the others here.",1

"I enjoy this series for the facts that it is science fiction and erotic and a little kick ass. I love the characters for not being boring but having some larger than life personalities with just the right amount of neurosis to make them very human and likeable. The worlds that they inhabit are just as varied as the people that live on them. This is the story of Steffania Rickard and Ramsey DeKieran's, the Captain of the Blue Daggers and a disgraced Lord who was found guilty of murder.

Captain Rickard is sent to bring Ramsey to meet with Ari and Doral to discuss a mission they wish him to under take that could mean a full pardon for him, if he returns. Ramsey has been a part of her fantasies since they fought side by side in the Haarb wars, but she would never give into them. Ramsey finds the Captain attractive but knows a woman like her could never give in to the types of hungers he has. Both are very wrong.

The pair are sent to bring back a Verdantian who is very important to the survival of the planet, Lady Alessa DeAlbero has been sold to Veacon Narr, a man who takes pleasure in bringing women to their knees. Everyone else who has attempted a rescue has not returned and he is considered to be expendable even if Steffania isn't. But together they find a way to do the impossible.

Though the story revolves around their rescue effort it is really about two people who have had the worst happen to them but are finding someone to complete them. Highly recommend.",1

"This skirt runs small. it is listed as a size large and by the sizing chart it is suppose to fit someone size 12-14. well im a small 14 and it is far from fitting me. it barely went over my hips and i was scared it was going to tear. I was hoping to wear this for a wedding this weekend but thats not going to happen. I would say the sizing is more of a size 10. There were no labels on this except one on the inside that had a 5 on it. nothing else. no care instructions or anything. I am on a weight loss journey so im going to keep it and make it my goal to get to. The inner material reminds me of slip material and it was clingy but that also might be because of the sizing..but it did seem to have quite a bit of static. The outer layer is a very thin see-through material. it is where the design in printed and it is very beautiful. the inner layer is about a foot shorter than the outer layer. The belt tie is my favorite part. It has beads and is made with real feathers. You can feel the stem in the fabric of the belt. over all if this skirt fit I would love it but until it does i just like it.

I have a similarly sized hard anodized professional skillet, but the convenience of a nonstick finish and glass lid was irresistible.

This is a good utility skillet for frying or cooking larger quantities of food. The better-designed Calphalon Contemporary see-through lid sits on the pan just right, and lets you check the progress of your food while sealing in flavor (and trapping aromas). (The less times you open the lid = better and faster cooking.) The silicone cover to the lid handle is a stroke of brilliance.

This pan also comes with an insulated silicone handle cover, which used to be an accessory item. Chalk that up as a value-add.

Cleanup is easy, just scrub out with warm water, mild soap and a nylon brush. Wipe dry and stow away.

'REMEMBER' is superb filmmaking.  Christopher Plummer is remarkable and we are fortunate that he was cast in this film and in this role.  This movie is what great filmmaking is all about.  Great screenplay and direction.  Don't want to give away any of the plot because I feel it will give away too much and spoil the excitement of the film.

"Bigger Thomas and his story of murder and societal havoc is a pretty damn good tale. Wright's penchant for defining Thomas by the horrid lifestyles of the African-Americans in this time is both thought provoking and a little misguided. B By and large blaming society for things like the graphic rape and murder of Bessie gets a little old by the end. It's simply seems like a ploy for an agenda, and boy is there an agenda and cause in this novel. Anyway, plenty of great criticism has sprung up around this book, and I recommend James Baldwin's piece after you are done with the novel.

Yes, it is true the society he lives in does create him and manifest his destination in some way, but the horrific things he does, and for having very few redeeming qualities, Bigger is definitely going to create division in people. And that is what I really don't like about him. His lawyer making the super tepid statement about his entire travails like it is almost okay that he exists because ""society did it"" seems ridiculous in context when you realize that people still have to bear their burdens, no matter what race or color, and Bigger chose to give in to his demons. No amount of patronizing or persuasion is ever going to make me totally see Wright's communist point of view and agenda in this novel, but it is well-written and worth the time to read it.

3.5 stars because of its amazing storytelling.",1

Unfortunately, although it is less messy than any other grinder I have owned, coffee grounds do get on the counter and cling to the nozzle after a few uses. Cleaning it is simple, but sort of a hassle because you need to empty out all of the beans. Overall I love this grinder. It has saved me money by consistently grinding the exact amount of coffee I want with no guess work or groggy counting. I like the appearance, but the lid is disappointing. Rather than matching the black and silver grinder it is an ugly grey. I wish Breville would have kept with the sleek black look.",1

The Acer Aspire I bought has 2gb ram and overall is quite fast enough for my uses and with all my Microsoft Office products.  The wireless works very good and I love the unit. I am an usually an Apple guy and really wanted a Mac Air but being that I had to buy an out drive to load software and watch DVDs plus tax I was looking at $1300 +/- a few dollars.  I decided that since I only really use this for traveling this would be a better deal and that it was.  The big negative on this unit however is the touch pad which is terrible and almost unusable to me and I have to use a mouse to really do anything or else you go crazy wasting time trying to point and click to the areas you want.  The pad just is not sensitive enough even after I adjusted as much as possible.  With the mouse it works great and it's really no big deal at least in the way I use it but if I had to continually use this with just the pad I would dump it for something else in a minute.  Overall though it is a a very good machine though.,1

"If they are shipped right they are supposed to be firm blocks that's easily crumbled into powdery flaky smell so good goodness for the cats (it appeals to my sense of smell and I HATE the smell of any wet can food)

I have no idea why people don't bother to just crumble it the way I do is just squeeze it firmly and add water and nutritional yeast (for the one cat with on/off diarrhea) and just give it a good stir. It takes less than a minute tops to be throughly mixed and water is absorbed. The cats do like it dry too but I rather have water in it to give them more moisture in their diet as they eat Orijen dry cat food. I also give them Stella and Chewys freeze dried food added into the mix some days as they eat that for treats.

My bengal is the picky eater the American Bobtail is the one with sensitive tummy and the sole reason why I brought a trail sized bag to test run it to give her supplements and she likes it as well as the Bengal so cant go wrong with this product but I strongly suggest you to purchase the trail size to test run it. Just crumble it its so easy to squeeze it and seeing it just flake away. I like the ease of grabbing a firm block instead of a messy thing.",1

I use it with my Kindle Paperwhite (2014). The fit isn't perfect, as it is designed for the Fire, but it works just fine. Inside there is a tab in each of the corners to hold down the tablet. Since this isn't spec'd for the Paperwhite, it doesn't fit in those tabs, so it can slide around.

"UPDATE#2 The tape that is used is not what I'm used to calling VHB. Dropped my hard hat last night and two holders popped off. Do not recommend.  UPDATE: After using these for a few nights, I discovered that two of them had moved on the hard hat. I don't know if it was the freezing temps outside, or the hot temps sitting on the dash in the truck. Whatever the reason, I had to replace the tape on one of them. The tape they use it not the same VHB tape that I have. And I have 3M VHB, right out of the box, that I have used for years, so I know mine is legit.) These are not good for hard hat use. Two Cons...The holders are flat. There really is no flat spot on a hard hat, so there will be a small space along the edge that will not adhere to the surface. Its why Go Pro makes curved helmet mounts. Its a big deal, because enough of the VHB tape does make contact. Also, the holders are two different sizes. There is no instruction as to which goes where. I placed the large ones toward the back of the hard hat, and I hope that is correct.",1

Like I said, my daughter takes her pups everywhere and sleeps with them each night. She has had this pup for almost a year and it is still holding up great! She's pretty dirty, but with a little cleaning she looks as good as new. I always spot clean her with a little water. I am impressed with the quality of the materials.

"Interesting design and I like the metal cabinet. The heater is nice for heating a select area as the warmth is directed towards the area it is directed at by the reflector surface behind the tubes while a lot of the heat comes out the top vents from the natural air flow. The wheels make it very easy to move to a different location. It did have a smell for the first fifteen minutes of operation but that was only the first time it was used. I don't hear any sound from it at all and the glow from the tubes has the brightness of a nightlight. Best feature I like is the four heat settings, each one turns on an additional tube for added warmth and allows me to set it for just the heat needed. The back and sides stay cool as the heat is directed out the front and the vented top. Only reason I didn't give it five stars was there was no color choice and I wish it had been cheaper to buy, but with the metal cabinet I guess the price is to be expected.",1

"I mounted several projectors before, and this mount is one of the poorest design.

First, documentation was almost non-existent. You will need to ""fill in the gap"", to figure out where all the screws go.  Most of the time, I had to improvise and even use some nuts and bolts from my own tool kit.

Second, the mount did not fit Optoma HD131Xe.  I played around with different configuration options, and finally had to bend one of the arms, and put some holes in another, just to make it fit.

Third, the sliding arm design is very poor.  There is very limited range of adjustment (15 degrees according to the manual, but more like 10 degrees), and adjustment screws are very hard to reach.  Most of the good design mounts have full 360 horizontal turning ability, but not this one.  Once you installed it, you are done.",1

"Technically, this is a romantic suspense which actually kept me guessing until the three-quarters of the book yet the love story Alan Mellington and Sarah Montgomery remained first and foremost in the storyline.

The serendipitous way they found each other and how their love for each other developed despite the social class barrier of early 19th century England is worth the read. Even the zealousness of a misguided local religious leader and how gossip leading to slander can hurt the innocent were described with no holds bar.

There is also good discussion about faith which will interest Christian readers.

"This series of books by ""Lemony Snicket"" does not have the standard ""happy ending"" of most children's books. The 3 kids in the stories (newly orphaned) have miserable lives with one thing going wrong after another. To make matters worse, their ""uncle"" - bad guy Count Olaf - wants their money and is always after them.  He and his evil minions are forever plaguing the lives of the Baudelaire children and cause constant mayhem.

Because of all this misery, I thought my 8-year-old son wouldn't like them - wrong! He absolutely loves them and is always begging me to read one more chapter! The writing is dry, but funny with loads of humor (much is directed to adults). The books contain many ""large"" or unusual words/expressions, but almost all are explained in the text (which can get annoying). I would say these books are good for kids from 7 - 14 (although use your judgement for the younger ones as the books do have evil bad guys, murder and lots of threats). As an adult reading the books to your kids, you might get a little frustrated as the stories are similar and the adults in the books are really dense - but these are for kids and they seem to love them!

The story is definitely moving along toward conclusion and we should have all the answers by book 13 (very appropriate!).  Readers will enjoy the series more if they are able to read the books in order as they build on each other - so this collection will be perfect for those new to the series - and the price is super.",1

I wear them to work all the time and they are a perfect size for me.  I have a hard time finding good nursing bras that fit me correctly.  They are a perfect size for me and I like that they do not fall out when I do not wear them for a long time.  I wear a size 10 and they fit perfectly.  I like the fact that they are a little longer than the ones I have tried on and I do not have to worry about the bra falling out after I have washed them.

"Feels durable when used, and yes, I've used it: Well, the bottle opener, anyhow! The day it came in, I put it on my neck before we went to dinner. My wife ordered the ""glass bottle"" (Mexican) Coke. The waiter said, ""Oh, I forgot my bottle opener, hang on a minute."" and I almost yelled, ""No, no! Wait! I've got a bottle opener."" And I dug this little guy out of my shirt, and pffft, opened that sucker right up! I mean, when does that ever happen? Maybe two times in 40 years has someone said to me, ""Uh oh, forgot a bottle opener"" and I got the best chance ever to show off my sweetie!

So, I can see using the bottle opener once in a while, the screw driver, the knife. I'm not sure how often I'll use the knife or the wire stripper. But like a wise reviewer previously said, it's nice to have a little fixed blade that doesn't make me look like some sort of paranoid knife nut. As I've already proven, this little knife (and tool!) is helpful.

PS For those of you who like a small knife for self defense (I carry a semiautomatic pistol and pepper spray instead) and want this because it's unobtrusive, keep this in mind: There is an almost exact same model sold by Shadow Ops. It's about the same price. Hell, it might even be the same knife. But if you're looking for non-tactical-looking, remember that the other knife says, very clearly on it: SHADOW OPS. If the law pats you down, it's harder, I imagine, to say that your Shadow Ops knife is harmless.",1

"This little tea set just makes no sense to me.  The tea pot doesn't actually open, so you can't actually pour water into it.  Ok, fine.  It does make a cool pouring sound, but only randomly.  Most of the time it just bursts into song when tipped, and then makes the pouring sound when you bump it with your elbow or something.  It would have been awesome to have the option of turning the music off and just having the pouring sound to play ""tea"" with.  The songs are just strange and annoying anyways.  The cups too, while cute, have two holes drilled on one side.  So, heaven forbid your child actually pour liquid in, if they happen to try to drink from that side the liquid will just pour out of the side of the cup onto their lap before it even reaches their mouth.  The cake stacker thingy is actually pretty cute and fun.  And, my kids love this little set and mix it in with their other kitchen toys.  It was a gift, so we will keep it, but I would not have purchased this for them on my own.  I feel like the makers of this set assume that kids need constant electronic stimulation to keep them entertained, but I think the opposite is actually true.

"We bought the matching Delta Soap Dispenser,RP71543RB, to the Cassidy High Rise Pull Down kitchen faucet - 9197-RB-DST.  Also bought the matching Dishwasher Air Gap.

The rubbed bronze finish was excellent and matched the Cassidy faucet.  The quality of construction was excellent.  The push down handle did not look cheap and feels like it will hold up to use.  The shape and size was really very good.  The bottle is very large, holds 10 ounces and can be filled from the top by simply removing the top push down handle.  Hint:  Use the funnel and no drops go on the counter top.  Instructions are on the back of the box.

Installation was quick and easy.

The shape of the base of the soap dispenser is very nice and the pinata was excellent.  The appearance is excellent and it looks great with the Cassidy faucet.  It doesn't look cheap like a lot of soap dispensers.  It's also considerably cheaper than a Moen soap dispenser.

"The Wedding Trap hit a bunch of sweet spots for me. It had a little suspense, a little steam, a heroine that was likable and it had humor. I love when a story makes me chuckle. There's nothing too slap-stick about the humor; it's mostly dry observations that the heroine makes about the absurdity of the situation in which she finds herself.

When attendees of Isobel's wedding aren't swallowing that Alex is Beth's boyfriend ""Charlie"", the rumors start swirling, much to Beth's mortification, that ""Charlie"" is really a gigolo she has hired to save face. Since Beth can't tell the truth about Alex being a CIA agent on a case, she has to roll with it.

EXCERPT:  ""Alex grinned. ""They all think I'm a prostitute, don't they?""

""Yep,"" she said. For some reason, Alex finding humor in the situation only darkened her mood further. It wasn't funny-it was disastrous. Spencer had gotten exactly what he wanted: she was a joke.

Given what had happened to her today, it shouldn't have mattered. But for some reason, it cut deep. She imagined what the epitaph on her gravestone would read.

Beth Bradley.

Liar. Sinner. John. ""

There were maybe some unrealistic moments in the plot as far as the CIA procedures go, but I don't know how they roll, so I don't really care. And this story takes place over the course of about 3 days or so and that's a short time to fall in love. But, again, I'm not reading romance for the realism. I would have liked an epilogue to find out how they settled into coupledom (I'm making up my own words, here). But there are two more books in the series and hopefully Beth and Alex will be mentioned so we can know how they fare.

This book is written in the 3rd person with both heroine and hero perspectives, it's unequal--there's more heroine than hero. I'd rate the steam at PG-13. There's a few scenes, but they aren't very explicit.",1

"I had never heard of John ed Bradley when I picked up this book but I was absolutely delighted with every page. It is a haunting and lushly romantic story about an artist whose abundant talents and extraordinary charm couldn't compensate for the fact that he lived in an era with a dichotomous attitude about people of other races. Bradley writes with a deft hand about art and his story is rich with the scents and sounds of New Orleans, a city I love, but there is a haunting mournfulness in this tale that is both sad and seductive.

I especially appreciated his passages about the WPA murals, a particular interest of my own.

Bradley's characters are likeable and fully human and his prose is rich. The scene toward the end of the book where the paintings are found reminded me of the scene in A.S. Byatt's ""Possession"" when Christobel's letters are discovered in the doll's cradle. This is a very rich book and Bradley is a writer of considerable skill.",1

"It's been a while since I've finished a book by Ian McEwan feeling more than satisfied, probably not since On Chesil Beach. From 1997-2001  it  seemed he couldn't miss. Then came a few rocky bumps including Solar, which was plain awful and stopped me from reading his books.

The first 20 or so pages of The Children Act promised to be a return to his heights. I was hoping. He has a knack of writing a gripping opening (notably Enduring Love) and then letting it slip a little... there was so much promise in the opening and then it basically deflated towards the end. He does seem to be predisposed to write about the upper middle class and their emotional problems as they drink fine wines and listen to classical music... alongside the freak-show of the lower classes and their predisposition towards stupidity, violence and slyness.

I wonder why I bother while there is a young man, David Mitchell, who is out there with thunder and lightening. McEwan's writing seems a bit dusty and uninteresting in comparison.

Still, I give it three stars, as he does have his moments.",1

"I bought this to carry my 29"" Trek Superfly on the back of my 2005 Chevy Impala (with spoiler). It fits very well and is very sturdy. I have full confidence it will carry the bike well and won't fall off or break.

A couple things to note... If you have a bike with a full suspension you'll need to buy the top tube bar separately. Allen makes one and it goes for about $15-20. Without this you won't be able to mount the bike on the supports due to the suspension being in the way. I recommend buying it regardless as the bike will sit much cleaner on the rack.

Also, make sure the bottom strap that goes to the underside of the bumper or bottom of the trunk is secured VERY WELL. Pull it a few time to make sure the clip doesn't pop off. There is nothing really good under my Impala's bumper to grab on to so you have to be sure it is secure. This may only be the case with my car but just thought you should know.

All-in-all, this bike rack is great and well worth the (actually low) cost.",1
"More garbage that's not anamorphic, it's anamorphic. The art style is pretty good. There's a lot of bright colors and clear colors. There are a lot of nice color tones and clear colors in this film. There is some color and contrast issues. The colors are mostly a bit muddy and look muddy and dull. The colors look great with a clean color palette. I just wish there were more colors. Overall, I'd give this film a 1/2 star rating. It's not a bad film, but it's not a great film either. It's not a good film either. It's a terrible film. It's not a good film either.

"I've got to tell you, I'm tired of all the zombie stuff that is being put out today, but this movie was fantastic.  It is almost reminiscent of the original Scary Movie in that it doesn't just make random pop culture references but actually spoofs and parodies the source material.  Combining The Walking Dead, Zombieland, and Warm Bodies; this movie crafts a fun plot with great comedic timing and acting.  The throne in references to Shaun of the Dead and Dawn of the Dead with a splattering of other classic zombie movies makes this a great time for fans of zombies and is great for a laugh.",1

"I love the P&P continuance stories and there are so few compared to the ""What if's "" that I am thrilled everytime I find one. This book did not dissappoint. Romantic, passionate and thrilling read. Loved this Elizabeth and Darcy. The plot was plausible and so were their reactions.

Loved how Elizabeth coaxed Darcy by humour and other means of persuasion rather than being insulted or timid.

The story begins as they leave their wedding breakfast and the night does not end well. The next morning comes with reconciliation and their bond grows stronger until a message is sent to Darcy from his former mistress brother. Instead of confiding in Elizabeth, he tries to manage the escalating problems on his own but Elizabeth is on to him...

Really loved this book and would love a sequal to see how Georgiana and Kitty got along. Their stories are left hanging. And of course, I can never get enough of ODC...

"My in laws got this for our son who is one this Christmas. He absolutely loves it! I put together a pros and construction based on my opinion:

Pros:
- it has three different paths it'll take depending on which position the rail switches are. This keeps it entertaining.
- very easy to put together. The instructions are very simple to follow. It is a little time consuming because you have to screw in nails about 15 times or more throughout. It probably took me about 30 minutes.
- it is well structured. I'm not too worried about it falling apart anytime soon. My one year old is pretty rough with it and it doesn't even flinch.
- comes with two cars (one boy and one girl). You can also use different cars to that you may already have like hot wheels and the smart wheels cars. Our kids have all kinds that they use.
- Even my 5 year old enjoys it. Sometimes I have to remind her that she needs to let her little brother play with it.
- No batteries needed! We all know that's always a plus.
- let's kids use their imagination! Any toy that allows kids to do this is a plus for me.

Cons:
- It is a bit large. We live in a apartment and this takes up a lot of space. It's about 37 inches tall and 18 inches in width. If you have the space, won't be an issue.
- It doesn't have two entrance paths so the cars can't race. This didn't seem like a big deal but my 5 year old has been taking about this, so I thought I would add that in here.
- There's a lot of pieces when building so for some it may be overwhelming. Don't worry the pieces all are numbered and colored so very easy to identify when building.

Overall, I would highly recommend this toy for little children. Even adults can have fun with it.",1

4 stars for Chicago-a shot to the heart changes everything by AJ Harmon.  If you are looking for a sweet, wholesome romance, this is the book for you!

When southern gentleman, Alex Beaumont, meets the tough yet sweet Mia from Chicago, they don't really think they would have anything in common. However, after having dinner one night, they each discover that they are quite attracted to one another.  They are each in their 30's, and shockingly, neither one of them has ever been in a serious relationship.  To say that they both need to experience that unconditional love and support in their lives would be a huge understatement.  It will take sacrifices on both sides, but if they are willing to take some risks, they might just find what has been missing in each of their lives.

AJ Harmon is an excellent wordsmith who brings both her characters and the places she writes about to life through her descriptive details.  I honestly felt like I was right there in the middle of the story alongside the characters experiencing their ups and downs with them.  I really look forward to reading more from this author!

The author gives a great deal of details about the history of the school, with some of the elements of the book being quite interesting.  I found myself thinking about the history of the school, and the people who were involved in the school, and the ways in",0

Just finished reading the 1st book in the series and just wasn't as happy with the ending.  I hope the series continues.I thought this book was a great first book in the series. It was well written and the characters were well developed. This was an excellent read.I loved this book. I have read the entire series and can't wait to see what happens next. I love the characters. I love the fact that the two families are all a part of the story. I love the fact that the kids were all raised in the same house. I love the fact that this book was written in a different time and place. I love the fact that the characters were all different and were all different.

"AMAZING!! Since I moved into my home 4 years ago, I have been trying to remove a lingering urine smell from my bathroom.

Disappointed that you can only use up to a 40 watt bulb.  Not nearly bright enough for over my island.  I've ordered something different.,1
"Whereas this device is a little bulky, the materials are good enough. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very heavy, and the cover is very large. If you are wearing a swim cap, you will need to hold it upside down. The material is not strong enough to hold your head and face in place, and it is a little uncomfortable to use for my purposes. The handle seems to be made of plastic, and the feel of the strap is not very comfortable. It is not hard to pull, but if you are wearing a small swim cap, it may be a little more difficult to pull it up.

Overall, I am very pleased with this product and would recommend it to anyone. It is a very nice design, and will do the job it is supposed to do.

I have really enjoyed all of Joseph Kanon books that I have read so far.  This book give good insight into Venice post World War II and the people who lived thru the Nazi occupation of the city.,1
Very bright light that is comfortable to wear.  It's nice that the light itself tilts and ratchets nicely from one angle to another.  There is no fear of it being too loose and drooping.  I chose this head light over others as it includes a USB power port to charge the batteries.  That enables me to charge the 18650 batteries with a solar charger if I wish.  This unit also works on a single 18650 which is handy if you had one charging but needed to use the unit.,1

"This movie did everything it could to compensate for not having even a halfway decent script. So with an attempt to dazzle with detail and glitter, it ultimately leads to the all-too-familiar growing and ragging beast who has (once again) sucked its energy from the city power supply and (once again) only becomes more powerful when it's attacked.

Was a bit cumbersome to use. Didn't realize I needed the battery pack that stored more charge. Two fully charged batteries died within 10-15 mins of use. I can't totally fault to mount but wish there was some kind of indicator on the adapter to let operator know how much charge left in battery.,1

"This was my third novel by author Lorraine Carey. I was expecting that same Classic Style of adventure, but in Out of the Ashes I found Carey had exhibited her ability to add a twist on that old Classic style using rich Native American legends with the paranormal. Dean Banks is a teen who lives out west and is not your normal teen . He inherits the ability to have superhuman powers from an ancient Apache shaman as he alone must destroy it before it destroys a centuries old gold mine. I loved how his bravery and strong sense of spirituality were brought out in this novel. There is a touch of soft romance here that will warm your heart.. I think this is bound to be the best seller for young adults.
If your child loves to read the DEAN BANKS ADVENTURES are a must read. If your kid doesn't like to read Lorraine Carey has a gift for making stories come alive. This may just be the answer to get your child to fall in love with the written word..",1
"I'm very happy to have made the switch from head scarf/sweat band to GUTR. Comes with easy adjustments for larger or smaller head sizes. Very comfortable...don't even know you have it on.

"So I had been behind on this series.  Then I binged all of them over last summer.  So when this book came out - I was way more than ready.  Charley and Reyes, omg, right?  I'm really late on this review, but here I am.  Better late than never!

I'm terribly sad that this series is winding down.  I heard there is one more book, but I don't know.  I am hoping there is.  But even then, I don't think it would be enough.

The series in general involves all of the things that I love.  Supernatural things, a badass woman, and a sexy dark man.  And the humor is top notch.

I don't want to give spoilers away, but the big secrets just keep coming out.  I don't know how Charley and Reyes will get through everything.  And this book in particular had some really heartbreaking things happen.  Let's just say at the end, there were tears.  Big fat sloppy tears and I feel like a big part of the heart of it all in this world Darynda Jones created will be forever bruised.  And then, as per I've become accustomed, the story ends with a BANG! and I'm frantic to read the next one.

If you've made it to the 12th book in this series, there's nothing I need to tell you.  You know Darynda Jones can create a world and make it revolve like nobodies business.  If you haven't gotten to this book, then you definitely need to.",1

"Dangerous Territory is an intriguing and exciting romance that takes you into the heart of the war in Afghanistan and into the heat of battle.  Grace Grainger is a journalist and a very good one.  She chooses to spend her time reporting on the lives of those who defend their country, living with them, much like her own tour of duty and is actually ""embedded"" into the team she is with.  Air Force Master Sergeant Josh Travers is a Pararescue Jumper and has done more than his share of tours overseas.  Both of them fantasize about the hot night they had with a stranger several years in the past, and both find themselves very surprised when in the heat of battle, the Pararescuer that comes to save the group Grace is with is the same hottie she got nasty with 3 years ago.

Thrown together in the middle of Afghanistan, the chemistry between these two is undeniably electric, despite the circumstances they find themselves in.  Then, there is the fact that Josh ""hates"" reporters, which presents a different problem.  The danger, drama, and romance in Dangerous Territory will keep you on the edge of your seat, while you fan your face from the heat that isn't even coming from the desert.  I enjoyed this military romantic suspense story, which is something different that I usually don't read, and was a very welcome change that I enjoyed.  I look forward to following this series to see what Emmy Curtis has in store for her readers next.",1

I like that the pieces are interchangeable so it's easy to assemble.  The included blocks are great for building with, but I wouldn't recommend building with them all.  Also, the blocks don't come with extra blocks.  The pieces come with two blocks to build with.  It's a great kit for an 8- or 9-year old.This is a very cool puzzle.  My daughter loves it.  I gave it to her as a gift for her birthday and she was very happy.  She is 5 and loves it.  The pieces are small and easy to handle.  I don't know if it will hold up for more than a few",0
"(review by my 14 yr old son): I love how the bow can change draw strengths. This allows me to progress to the full draw weight when I get stronger. I also love the bow's design and that I came with some powerful aluminum hunting arrows. I don't hunt but I do recommend this bow for any youth interested in bow hunting. Despite all the perks there are a few things I don't like. Though the package/carry case is a great way to carry your bow, you're unable to put the bow on it if you've installed the arrow holder and must remove it before putting the bow back on (I just don't use the arrow holder at all due to this). Worst of all the arrow rest strips the arrows' fletching and broke on my second shooting trip after the 14th shot just because I shot an arrow. Now That's just stupid. I'm just glad they're easily replaced by wisker biskets

Overall this is a good bow but could do with some design flaw fixes. (He ended up returning the bow.",1

"I buy (subscription) other Beyond canned foods but when I opened Beef & Spinach and I thought it must be spoiled. It had such a rotten smell, I opened 2 more cans to compare. They, too, smelled rotten - like a decayed tooth.  My dog didn't seem averse to the smell, but she's a rescued dog & will probably eat anything.  With some trepidation I gave her some.  Several hours later she had terrible gas, followed by diarrhea.  She has no problem w other flavors.

"I only use my kindle for text to speech. Sometimes in my excitement I miss the little mention that the publisher has chosen not to let me use the product this way. I have then paid for something that is useless for me. The publisher arbitrarily chose to disable this feature, it makes no impact on them, but for me it's the difference between an enjoyable book and a waste of money.

I eventually got the book through other means and enjoyed it well enough. It wasn't edifying or memorable, but at least it was interesting and provided a somewhat fresh perspective on a global-scale zombie outbreak. In reading this and the Zombie Survival Guide, I get the feeling that Max Brooks pulls a lot of stuff off the top of his head, and his books would benefit from a greater degree of authenticity that comes with more thorough research, something sorely needed in taking a supernatural situation and making it believable. I'm talking about details of combat medicine, traumatic stress, cultural and geographic specificity, fleshed-out characters. Like the animated corpses that shamble through this narrative, I want something to sink my teeth into.",1

"Great little juicer!!!  Started using it the night it arrived.  So far I've put apples, carrots, beets, greens, oranges, grapefruit, peaches, plums, onions, garlic, kale, spinach and sweet potatoes through it.  Of all of that, only the beets and sweet potatoes have been an issue.  Their stringy material tends to try and bind the auger but simply turning backwards and loosening it up sends it on through.  The cranking isn't overly difficult or strenuous, although I do wish it would extract a bit more juice, the pulp is still a bit damp when extracted.  Still, all in all for someone that's just starting into juicing, I think it's pretty great.  I should note this was originally bought for wheatgrass juicing and it arrived 5 days faster than I expected so my wheat grass is still growing and not ready to put through it.  Beat tops, carrot tops, kale, and spinach all went through fine, so I'm sure the wheat grass will also.",1
I am very disappointed in this product and the quality. I will not recommend it to anyone. Great product. Great price. I am using it with a TRS-80 and it works just fine. It is a good value.

I have it paired with my Kindle Fire HDX. I am very pleased with this charger. I have been using it for a couple weeks and it has been working flawlessly.

"This was an Amazon freebie and I received an ARC in exchange for an honest review.

While I read the first two books, I didn't really care for the rest of the story. The first one was really good, but the second one was really bad. There was no real story to it.

I did get a little frustrated with the hero and heroine, but I didn't really care about them. I think that they were all just a bunch of idiots.

I really liked the hero, and I really liked the heroine. She was a strong heroine who had a lot of issues. She was a bit naive at the beginning, but she grew on me as the book progressed.

I really liked the villain, and he was a good guy. He was a bit of a jerk, but I didn't care about him.

I really liked the ending. I was hoping that there would be a sequel. It didn't really happen.

I did like the other characters, but I didn't like the ending. I would have liked to have had more characters.

I really liked the ending. It was a nice little surprise.

Overall, I was really impressed with this book. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good story, with some twists and turns.

I received an ARC of this book from Amazon in exchange",0

"I ordered the lobster costume and it arrived with a very small opening.  The dimensions were just right.  The costume is very tall and the size is perfect for a small dog.  I am extremely pleased with this purchase.I was skeptical about the price for this product but I found it a bit too expensive. I did get a medium and a large but the medium was great. I just wish it came in a different color for my dog because it is hard to see her from the side of the house. I would have been happy with the medium. I was just too big for my dog and the size is too small for my dog. I have a 14 lb dog and I found this size and it was perfect. I can see why the price was a bit high but I was able to find it at a very good price. I will never buy this again.Very cute, very well made and really works.  I would buy again if I were able to.

Dual Stage Furnace works as designed even though this thermostat is manufactured by Honeywell (and is a lot cheaper than the Trane branded thermostats).  Very happy with this Honeywell unit and like the various customization features it offers me.  FYI, the Wi-Fi feature works as they all do; i.e., your smart phone connects to your home wi-fi connection, which then connects to Honeywell's server via the internet, with the Honeywell server then sending your commands back to your home wi-fi connection via the internet, which then communicates directly with the thermostat unit.  Thus, your smartphone interacts with Honeywell's off-site server and not directly within-your-house with your thermostat unit.",1
"This was another mesmerising book about Shifter Grove and I thoroughly enjoyed the story;  it was a pleasure to read.  Danni feels betrayed by her boyfriend Taylor and moves to Shifter Grove, where it not only calls to her, but she is able to realise her dream.  Taylor doesnt give up though  he is relentless in his pursuit.  Danni, meanwhile, finds trust, friendship and love in Shifter Grove.  Rhett and Rush have returned home; they are billionaires but know that money cannot buy happiness.  They have made a promise to their father, and there is no way they can go back on this, irrespective of the consequences.  Danni has forgotten what it is like to date or how to get to know someone again after Taylor, but fate plays a hand although it is not all plane sailing.  This book was very well-written, and was a heart-warming and engaging story, which I would have no hesitation in recommending.  I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.",1

"After 4 months!  Sometimes I go several days without using it. When I do use it, it may be for only 5 minutes or up to 90 minutes.  But, its got enough hours on it that I was VERY impressed at the battery life.  I use it 100% for podcasts.  Usually it sits in the cup holder of my truck to listen to while driving or I use it while doing household work like washing dishes or putting away laundry.  For these tasks, it works awesome!  It pairs very easily to my ipod touch 4 as well as my iphone 5.  It is an excellent product for the way I use it.  A negative is when I paired it with my Vizio TV I was unable to adjust the sound.  The speaker has no sound adjustments and my TV volume would not work with it.  Also, I don't know why some people rave over the cup, seems like about a 50 cent cup to me:/

"I purchased this after a friend recommended it to me.  I am not a power baker.  I merely make the usual things for my family and the occasional specialty items.  I find it mixes faster than my old stand mixer, and it takes less space on my counter.  Contrary to other reviewers, I find it does cream sugar and butter well, BUT I have to use a rubber spatula to push it off the center post.  MY machine came with instructions to NOT use the center addition for the smaller jobs like this since it produces better results, so that is how I have done it.

In addition, I noticed straightaway that the directions stated to ensure you run the machine at least 5 minutes before you do ANYTHING in it to make sure the lubricants do their job BEFORE you use it for mixing. I did that, and I've heard no odd noises coming from my machine.

It IS loud.....much louder than my stand mixer, but I wasn't going for a silent machine.  Frankly, I have dexterity issues, and I wanted one that wasn't overly heavy, with a bowl that wasn't overly heavy, and that was easy to clean without having to wrestle it all over the kitchen (with my issues, that's common).  My friend suggested that this would probably tick off all those checkboxes, and she was right.

For what I use it for, I LOVE it.  It is also easy to clean, the parts store in the top, and it does what I ask it to.  I also got the blender attachment with mine, and it blends stuff that my bullet cannot.  I don't use it OVERLY often, but when I need a blender, it's a champ.  The only thing I don't like about the blender is that you cannot remove the bottom and blades to clean it.  If I used it daily or for anything very sticky, that would bother me, but I'm just a batter making, smoothie making gal, and it's great for that.",1

"As some of the other reviewers has stated, this is definitely a version 1.0 product.  I'm on an Android phone and the app is missing the ability to view the camera remotely. You can't simply use the Skybell app to see if everything is OK at the door.  The motion detection doesn't work, and you have to press the door bell before it'll send you an alert.  This was supposed to be working when they shipped.  I emailed them directly to check before ordering.

The Android app is crashing when you try to configure some things.  Android tablets are not all supported so you can't use all your mobile devices inside your home to view the Skybell activity. I have an Acer and the app will not install on the device. This is limiting as you always have to have your phone near you.  Hope they fix this soon.

I had my WiFi access point configured for N-Only as I do not have older 802.11b/g devices.  It never connected to the 2.4Ghz N-Only radio.  I had to go back into the WiFi AP and reconfigure to support the older 802.11b/g devices.  It says it's N compatible, but looks like it may not be.  This delayed the install procedure as I tried 5 times to get the device connected to the WiFi before taking a look at the WiFi AP settings.  So if you're having problems connecting it to your WiFi, double check this setting.

I think the concept is a really great idea and hopefully these items are simply version 1.0 growing pains.  Wait a few months for the product to mature.  If they can get the rest of the features in and fix the app bugs, it'll be a cool product.",1

For large fingers the center of the remote could be a little cumbersome.  The buttons seem a little close to me and I have medium sized hands.  That is the only tiny issue.

The remote emits a stronger signal than all the original remotes is seems!  I can point it anywhere and it will do the job.

DVR controls work perfectly.  The button layout is different ( DVR remote) but took me a few minutes to figure them out and get use to it.

"Originally released in 1934 as ""Babes in Toyland,"" this film is far and away the best of the Laurel & Hardy operettas.  The evil Barnaby (Henry Brandon), wants to force the lovely Bo-Beep (Charlotte Henry) to marry him.  Towards this end Barnaby banishes Bo-Beep's beloved Tom-Tom (Felix Knight) and attempts to take over Toyland with his demon army.  Fortunately, Stannie Dum and Ollie Dee, the assistants of the Toymaker (William Burgess), save the day with the help of the marvelous giant-sized Wooden Soldiers.  Based on the operetta by Victor Herbert (several songs are omitted), this film was directed by Gus Meins and Charles Rogers, and is much superior to the Disney version that ended up replacing it on television.  You will find less slapstick than usual in a Laurel & Hardy film, but the boys are better integrated into this musical than any of there others and Brandon's Barnaby is deliciously wicked.  Fortunately ""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" has been restored and is now available so it can become the classic it deserves to be.",1

"I'm very pleased with the 4th addition update of The C++ Programming Language.

Dr. Stroustrup takes the approach of presenting the current version of the language (C++ 11) as a whole, rather than attempting to show what's new in C++ 11 compared to C++ 03.  At approximately 1300 pages of text, it takes commitment to make it through the entirety of the content, but you'll most likely be a better programmer if you do.

If you've attempted to read previous versions and didn't like Stroustrup's approach, then you probably won't like the new edition either.  On the other hand, if you appreciated the 3rd edition, you will probably like the 4th edition as well.

He presents the language in a rather terse style of writing with very short and fairly contrived examples, so it's probably not the best book for beginners.  On the other hand, if you are already an intermediate to advanced C++ programmer, he explains a lot of the finer points very clearly.  Some of the topics he addresses are difficult to find documented elsewhere. For example the precise type of literals -- 3, ""foo"", 4.0, 5.1f;  internal vs external linkage; unnamed namespaces; etc. Since he invented the language and is a very active member of the standards committee, you can trust that the information is accurate.

One of the other things I like about this book is the fact that Stroustrup is wiling to editorialize just a bit and describe things that he considers to be ugly, embarrassing, or bad style.  He manages to do this without ranting, which is really nice.  He also gives advice about constructs to avoid and techniques to embrace.

Happy reading and good luck!",1
"These batteries can be one of two ways. One can hold a charge for seven or eight minutes or thirty seconds. The added weight makes it a ""Balancing game"" If it's too far forward, the chopper won't hold a hover. It's a coin toss. I put one in my mini Chinook and it flew almost 10 minutes. In my 107g, it seemed to cause the circuit board to malfunction making the 107g fly out of control. My advice, use the same type battery that came with the chopper. Understand that these batteries will start to quit holding a charge very soon. They are like store brand batteries opposed to Energizer or Duracell. Know how to solder if you plan to replace one.",1

It's a little pricey for a lamp but I don't think you'll be disappointed.  I have a few of them in the house and they are bright enough to see without being too bright.  I highly recommend it to anyone who needs an accurate, accurate, accurate light for their home or work.I bought this as a replacement for my old version of the LED bulb that was discontinued and replaced with this.  The replacement bulb is not as bright as the original, but still works great.  I also like the color temperature range and the fact that it's a 5W LED bulb.  It's very cool to be able to adjust the light output of this bulb, but not too bright.  I will probably get another one for a friend or family member who uses it.  The other bulb I have is a 5W LED, so I would recommend this bulb to anyone who",0
"My son received both the Stomp Launcher and Stomp Rocket Jr Glow as gifts and he loves both of them. The Stomp Launcher is nice because it doesn't go as high or far so it is a good alternative to outdoor play when it is raining out as it has been here lately. The Stomp Rocket Jr Glow is the one he prefers though because it does go higher and as it has been raining for so long here I closed off the entertainment center and let him play with both in the room with a vaulted ceiling. They are both great, but for different reasons. The Stomp Launcher is a little sturdier, but the step pad is smaller and the cord is shorter so with not as much air the rockets don't go as far but he loves that the rockets look more like a space shuttle style rocket. I suppose if I were to suggest one over the other I would recommend the Stomp Rocket Jr Glow unless you planned to use it inside at all then I would recommend the Stomp Launcher.",1

"This book contains 90% very accurate descriptions of characters and personality of the 12 chinese signs x the 12 western signs. I got this book many years ago, and it is accurate when I read her readings for my father, sisters and friends. I would say I find her description to be 90% accurate, I think the 10% deviation may be factoring in environmental influence (eg. if she says this person likes to dress up or vain, but sometimes if the person is brought up in a family or culture that doesn't support that, or if the person is not physically attractive, they may do the reverse from low self-esteem etc). But nonetheless, her description of people's personality and character is usually very spot on.

I used her book to read several of my girlfriends, it is incredible. The ones Suzzane say that are loving, kind natured, nice,- they are indeed very nice and loving! The ones she says are cheerful and humourous- they are indeed those who like to laugh and joke! She said my father's sign is a 'born winner', she is right too, for my dad worked from a job of a teacher to become a multi-millionaire investor and director. She said I'm the sincere and serious/hardworking type,and I make a livelong good friend, well that's also true as I have many friends whom I knew since kindergarten and primary school!",1

"This movie is as funny as parts of the other 2 at times but i wouldnt say its as good. It has some funny moments but also some very stupid non funny moments. The other 2 movies were pretty funny throughout the whole movie and this one has hits and misses. There were parts i was laughing till i almost cried and other parts that were not funny at all. This one has more parodys of sci fi movies mainly and 8 mile. The last 2 focused more on horror. Here they parody the movie signs , the ring and 8 mile. The last 2 films had more movie parodys of all diffrent horror films and this film has popular culture parodys and sci fi. If your a fan of the first two , get this one to complete the trilogy and if you havnt seen the others or just thought they were so so rent this. Youll get a couple good laughs. Also i don't agree with the reviews that say the only funny parts are in the movie commercials they showed. All the funny parts i saw were not in the commercials and the one from the commercial ( the Micheal Jackson part) wasn't that funny and that wasn't really Micheal Jackson, it was a micheal jackson imitator.

"5'6"" and 125. I have literally tried on about 30 pairs of jeans this year. Gap, Lucky Brand,Express,Saks, Macy's,seriously if they are known for their jeans have been there. Who is shaped that way.? A mid-rise jean is not 10 inches from your crotch to your waist? Legs so tight they all wound up inside out , crotch up on the dressing room floor! Sorry to the help but when the leg openings are so tight I am wrestling them off they can untangle the wretched things. The mid-rises hit half way up my back! I am 65 years old so white jeans are very tricky. These are perfect. I hate paying this much for a single pair of jeans but I am NOT sending these back as I expected to.. Good weight and still not see through? I thought they were going to be lightweight and they are but not too thin/thick. The rise is a perfect 8 inches/zipper 4 inches and the leg openings allow someone with a calf muscle to move  and they don't ride up. I've had them on about 3 hours now and yeah they stretch out a little but in a good way. I can sit cross legged on my bed w/o discomfort! But these jeans!

While I watched this movie I figured that somewhere along the line, something had to make sense. It didn't.  Besides, just because a movie is obscure, strange, whatever, doesn't make it deep!

I watched it on Netflicks (instant on Roku), so at least I didn't waste money on it.  Actually, I've had more interesting nightmares!!  Humm.......maybe I should make a movie.

Can THE SHADOW's alter-ego, Lamont Cranston (Kane Richmond) track down the real killer, before the police close in?

"Way back, you used to need a prescription, then it was over the counter yet still pricey. Well on Amazon you can get flea and tick protection much cheaper. However if you have long haired dogs such as German Shepherds, Huskies, etc topical flea treatments may not work well for you. I use this on my Jack Russells and haven't seen a single flea or tick and been using it for years. When I used it on my Huskies though I don't think it was able to get down to the skin well and I still saw fleas/ticks, so I use Trifexis for them, an oral flea preventative.

"Months ago, Farrah Langley and Xavier Kane engaged in a hot affair that last nearly a year. Upon a chance meeting in New York, the two run into one another and sparks still fly between Xavier and Farrah. As the two rekindle their relationship, Xavier realizes that the chemistry between them is more than just sex. Will Xavier be able to convince Farrah that they are perfect for one another?

Bachelor Unleashed is an enjoyable read. The sex scenes were scorching and incredibly vivid. The author took care to give incredibly descriptive scenes of New York that made me feel as if I were there with the two characters. However, it was odd that Ms. Jackson didn't devote the same amount of description to her main characters.

Bachelor Unleashed by Brenda Jackson is the second book I have read from this author. As this is a series, I would strongly urge the reader to read the first book, Bachelor Untamed. I greatly enjoyed the characters but felt left out as I didn't truly comprehend the significance of certain minor characters. Despite those minute misgivings, I thoroughly enjoyed the chemistry between the two main characters. I couldn't help but rooting for Xavier as he ruthlessly courted Farrah. I feel that Ms. Jackson writes wonderful characters and has a talent for writing brilliant settings that I must visit one day soon.  Being well satisfied by Ms. Jackson's writing, I look forward to reading another story by her in the future.

"This is an excellent toy for my whale shark loving 4 year old. Reasons we love it:
- beautiful paint and coloring, very true to life
- no open areas in the plastic so it can go in the bath with no risk of mold
- very good size compared to other ocean animal toys, so it has the feeling of being whale like!

It is pretty heavy and the fins are hard plastic. I suppose it could hurt to step on, or hit a sibling with, but this is a great whale shark. If you're a marine enthusiast I could see it working as a display for adult collectors as well since it's life-like (not cartoony).",1

"When is the next book??  Wow!  This was sooo good!  It was very hard for me to put this book down once I started it.

The story was well written to the point I cried at times.  I could feel the pain and angst the main character, Ana, was going through.  Ana doesnt reveal what happened in her past right away but there were enough hints that I was heartbroken for her.

I was rooting for Ana through the whole book and it was a complete rollercoaster for her (as well as for me!!).

I don't want to give anything away as to what happened with Ana but there is a huge cliffhanger at the end of the book. It was one of those that sucked the air out of my lungs because I couldn't believe what just happened.  It was one of those endings that I had to sit back and give myself some time to digest and figure out what I will read next.

Dujardin is brilliant at dumb-cluck-worthy mannerisms and quirks. Chasing bad guys down the back alleys of Cairo? You'd expect our hero, as heroes often do in their more suave and debonair incarnations, to run swiftly and with no uncertainty around corners, never slowing down or stopping. Not Agent 117...he has to stop completely, in a tense, crouching stance, in which he pivots, to look all directions, before he continues...not once, not twice, but at every single corner or intersection in the chase.

"Dorian Devil is the type of character you want to know more about the further his story develops. In Venice, we are introduces to parts of Dorian that were not provided in the first book Denver. We get to see why he seems like a jerk one moment and a nice guy the next. The poor guy was being gunned for by his own family. Who wouldn't be a little emotionally scarred from that? On top of that, in this second installment of The Enchanter, the hunters are attempting to wipe out an entire city's paranormal population; and Dorian recognizes the magic involved - you guessed it, family. The only way to stop it is to try and get the entire city to work together, but that is like herding cats, literally and figuratively, maybe. If the spell Dorian used in this book was real, I would be the first in line to purchase it, because who wouldn't like to loose a few pounds and never see them come back? Especially if it helped a guy like him?
I love this series and the characters that we are being introduced to. I cannot wait to see what is next for Dorian. I am waiting on pins and needles to see who, or maybe what Mikas is to him and how Dorian's apprentice is. I have always wanted to find a good series to read where the main character always continues on and their story develops as the world continues. I do believe I have found that story. Move over Sookie Stackhouse, Dorian Devil is the new main character to follow.",1
"I found the book to be very interesting and agree for the most part with the author.  However, I am not sure ALL murderers have had a bad upbringing where they were whipped or even abused.  I am sure there are cases where this is not so.  It would be interesting to examine more cases especially here in America.  I was raised by a half German and half English mom and was not abused much.  I turned out to be a happy and productive person.  I do not blame my mom for her abuses which were there but nobody is perfect and she grew up with the threat of the strap herself.  I do not see the purpose in blaming parents except in the cases described in the book.  To me I wonder if it is more of a German problem but I am probably nave to think that.  As stated in the book it is not limited to just one country.  I know from the parenting books out now (since I am a parent to two girls myself) in America the opposite is the case.  It is a fear to even raise a hand to a child because of the consequences.  Which is good.  My sister has perfectly mannered children who have never been harmed physically and I hope emotionally as well.  Although I do not know.  My children are not well behaved but they are allowed to be children and I try not to be permissive but it happens.  A very quick read for I read it in less than a week.  Nice read.  It kept me entertained.  A little too much on Hitler though and I did not care to read about the child murderer either.",1

"There are several choices when it comes to cooking utensils: Stainless remains my favorite choice given that it is dishwasher safe, sturdy enough to hold up under force, and thin enough that it can easily get under the cooked product. Silicone, also dishwasher safe, has the advantage of being good for teflon-coated pots and pans but the disadvantage of rarely being tapered sufficiently to get under, say, a sunny-side up egg, without damaging the appearance of the food. Bamboo is a great alternative; though you have to hand wash wood utensils, wood is generally stronger than silicone and can still be used in teflon-coated cookware. The trick, though, is that it has to be cut properly.

This set could have used a little more in the finish department. The colored handles are a nice touch, but the half that touches food is rough to the touch, not quite sanded sufficiently, and doesn't come to as thin an edge as is necessary on the spatula tools. Further, the slotted cuts on two of the utensils had left a few bits of little wood splinters that I needed to make sure were thoroughly removed when I first cleaned the items. The wood was also finished with a light outer coating - some type of urethane? - that wasn't smoothly applied. There are areas which lack the coating, and some areas which appear to have blotches and extra coating.

So overall, the set is ok, particularly as a lightweight set for a camp or RV stove, but at home you would likely be better served with two or three higher grade utensils than this set.",1

"I bought this book with great expectation having read the glowing reviews here at amazon.  The premise of the story sounded intriguing---two 'ordinary' couples meet and form a friendship that lasts a lifetime.  Alas, real life is often dull and this book redefines dull.  The promise of youth and the sadness of aging no matter how gracefully, the love that endures sickness and health, the value of true friendship are all examined and with introspective honesty.  However, what isn't in the book, the great moments glossed over or ignored, left this reader wondering how Wallace Stegner got to be so renowned.
On a more positive note, if you can endure the first 3/4 of the book, the last 1/4 will be uplifting.  The reader will finally get some insight into Charity and Syd's dysfunctional marriage, Larry's unquestioning love for the invalid Sally, and the universality of Stegner's premise that one of us doesn't differ that much from another, each generation repeating its parents so that everything returns upon itself, repeating and renewing until the present can hardly be told from past.
Stegner writes a convincing enough narrative about the grace of surviving life, but as for me, the next time I want a story about nothing, I will tune in to a Seinfeld rerun.",1

"I was very pleased with the value of this trimmer.  It ran great right out of the box.  My only issue is that there isn't much line included, and it came loose one time and I had to stop to remove and reassemble the entire bobbin.  I found the forward loop handle to be a bit too small to easily balance and manuver the head, especially since a sholder/neck strap was not included.  After some practice, I got the hang of it, but I will be looking for a strap to add.

The Expand-It system promises to make this even more of a great value.

No issues with the reconditioned product, simply came in a brown box and has a ""RECON"" stamp in the plastic.

UPDATE:  After about 4 years of normal use and standard maintenance, this trimmer finally died on me.  Everything was in good working order, but for some reason the piston seized up and the connecting rod broke.  The oil was topped off and fresh, there were no indications of a pending failure.  I am really disappointed, but can't really complain.  I have since gone back to a 2-stroke trimmer because ultimately, for the application, the 4-stroke is a bad idea.",1

"To preface, I have a one year old pit bull mix who chews through EVERYTHING. The only toy she has yet to destroy is her black kong, of which she doesn't actually chew on too much. That being said, this seemed like a pretty sturdy toy so I got it since she loves squeak toys and I was looking for something that would actually hold treats and make her work for them. It took about three weeks for her to chew off one of the legs, at which point the toy was still functional, and was actually longer than I was expecting that particular leg to last as she started chewing on it the day she got it. A week later the belly started to tear at one end of the insert, but again, was still functional. A week after that, she chewed through the middle of the body leaving all but the squeaky head (of which she isn't particularly interested in due to the force it takes to make it squeak) no longer functional. Overall, it lasted around 5 weeks, which while I obviously wish it had lasted longer, I'm still generally pleased with the length of time it lasted considering the amount it was played with (a lot but not a TON). I'm considering getting another one but haven't yet decided. I wish they'd make something similar but without legs.

SUMMARY:

PROS:
-Holds up pretty well with major chewers, and probably indestructible for other dogs
-Multi functional as chew toy and very interactive treat dispenser (as well as floats and what not)
-kept my dog occupied when filled with treats or kibble (kibble worked best actually)
-cute
-squeaker isn't too loud

CONS:
-not indestructible for big chewers
-the stupid legs (They're it's weakest point)
-the amount of pressure needed to squeak the head made my dog disinterested in its squeaking ability (but was interested for food purposes)
-Price (which would be totally reasonable to me if it lasted for more than 5 weeks)",1

"Several of the science fiction ""classics"" I have read recently have proven to be rather less than classic for me. However, War of the Worlds is not one of them. I found it to be enjoyable, interesting, with an ability to keep me interested and engaged.

I was surprised when I started the book that it is NOT like the Orson Wells version of radio and movie fame. This is set in England at the end of the 19th century. This definitely limits the defensive abilities of the Earthlings compared to the movie. It is also part of what makes it interesting, because the Martians react much differently than the movie version as well. They are slower, more definite in their movements, and more connected between landing spots. Also, there are only ten landing spots for the Martians, it seems, rather than the world-wide invasion of the movie version. In fact, one area that left me questioning was what the rest of the world was doing while this went on in southern England?

The sample section of the book ""The Map of the Sky"" should have been left out, in my opinion. It was pompous and self-important, and was not in any way enjoyable, nor did it succeed in making me want to read a book that obviously was merely a ""tag-along"" story with little interest of its own.

The writing style was excellent, fast-moving overall though not without some hefty explanation sections. Grammar, spelling, word use, all are what one would expect from a consummate professional. I held off reading this book for quite a while after I downloaded it, in the fear that it would be another disappointing ""classic"". It was nothing of the sort; it is an excellent book of early science fiction, and a very enjoyable read.",1

"First, let me say the obvious; for $100 this isn't cutting edge electronics so temper your expectations accordingly.  Having said that, this is a nice little tablet for the price as long as you keep it simple.

PROS:
Crisp display and at 7"" a nice viewing area.  Steams movies well with very minimal issues.
Comes with quite a few bells and whistles (so-so camera, assortment of apps, and some nice features such as weather updates and news)
Great for reading newspapers, books, and surfing non-graphic intensive web pages.

CONS:
Virtually no storage area, buying an expansion card is almost a must
Not powerful enough to play any graphic intensive apps.  Tried playing a simple app like Simpsons Tapped Out and it's very choppy and stutters.
Not a fan of the button placement but getting used to it.

Overall I'm happy with it.  I got it as a handy tablet to look up information quickly without going upstairs and starting my desktop computer.  Yes, it has it's limitations but I didn't spend $500 either.",1
"I reviewed this movie after seeing it in theaters and gave it 3 1/2 stars. It has grown on me after seeing it a second time. I think it is on par with the first film, but the FF movie series suffers from too much comedy! I like comic book films to be fun but, it took away the drama in this movie and our heroes seemed to be in no danger. When the Thing gets hurled into Mr. Fantastic and they are imbedded in a wall the Thing's states ""That Smarts""! and peels Reed off the wall like a cartoon!

Although funny, too much of this just made it seem like a parody. The Thing's rocky exterior looks much better this time around and so are the effects. The Silver Surfer is a welcomed addition to the franchise and his FX are done extremely well! I know a lot of people were disappointed in Galactus being presented as a cloud but, I think an armor clad giant with a purple helmet would look ridiculous floating though space eating planets. The film is a bit short, but over all it's fun and captures the essence of the comic book.

This film is not perfect, but it is entertaining for fans of the series. I hope there will be a third entry in the series. I would like to address some problem with the Thing. I can see cross over's galore in the future and the Thing as he has been presented in these films wouldn't last one second with the Hulk if they ever do battle in a live action film! Anyway there will be lots more Marvel in the future.....I can't wait! The DVD transfer looks fantastic and there are plenty of extras to keep you busy.",1

"I've had this shape wear for nearly one year.  It probably does run a tad small but it also needs to be snug to do its job.  I am short- 5'2""- and (was) 40ish lbs overweight so I ordered the L.  It fit very well with no riding up or sliding down at all.  There are no lines visible on your clothes to even hint that you're wearing something like this.  I ended up ordering another in the 2nd color & wear one or the other most days. It hasn't seemed to wear out in any way with numerous washings over the year.  In fact, drying them helps them regain snugness.  After a decent weight loss, it obviously doesn't work quite as well but I like the product enough to order both colors in a smaller size, perhaps even a couple of each.  They are comfortable and just help me feel sleeker, whether it's under a business suit, dress, or jeans!  Honestly, I feel wrong going without them now.  Compared to most effective shape wear, you simply cannot beat the price.  At my height, it does pull up to my bra line, which seems appropriate to me.

I definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to smooth out their shape & just feel slimmer!",1

"I caught a portion of this movie on TV and it made me curious.  I found some time to kill and watched.  I was pleasantly surprised to find a good story, good acting, and a bit of a surprise twist towards the end.  There were some major production/ storyboard/ screenplay errors.  Like when the units go to the field and the whole thing is cut short, it was a surprise, but the execution was forced and it seemed like a story rip-off.  That part of the story/ screenplay cheapened the whole film and left me feeling empty, like something was missing.  Overall a good film, just a couple of portions felt unfinished.",1

"Purchased this stroller September 2013 to help my beagle with a ligament issue in his back leg take a break on walks. At first I was happy with the quality of the stroller including the wheels (actual tires with inner tubes) and the ability to easily lock the stroller in place. It also gave us the freedom to go on longer walks. However as reported by another reviewer, despite the stroller saying ""up to 70 pounds"" this was completely inaccurate. As such, my dog would take up the entire stroller which put strain on some of the mesh panels which then began to unravel. Since the stroller did give us the freedom to move about I kept it and made repairs every time a section came undone though over time the separation in the fabric occurred all over the stroller and not just where he would lean. The stroller had major patchwork from all my repairs but I was going for function over looks. However, with continued use the frame became a quite wonky though still usable but the final nail in the coffin occurred today when one of the back tires broke off while we were using it. I'm going to research how much a spare tire would cost but frankly, after 2 1/2 years of intermittent use I expected it to last a  bit longer considering the price I paid at the time, $216 plus tax. If you have a small dog-less than 25 lbs, this stroller may work for you but if we decide to get another stroller I don't think I will go with this brand.",1

Mercy does what she does best, protecting those who need protection, creating a situation that puts the pack in danger and has Adam take action.

These are the only balls that my dog will play with. I particularly like them because they don't get all wet and slobbery like the tennis balls.  We have tried other chuckit! balls like the one that whistles and glows in the dark and my dog will run after them but not retrieve those for some reason.  They last longer than any other balls that we have bought.  After a while of 2 dogs playing keep away from each other they can crack.  The only thing that would be a negative for me is that I wish you could buy more than 2 in a package.  I have had one stuck in the tree and then go on a trip and leave the other behind and my dog is lost with out his chuckit! ball.,1
"Ok, for a darkly introspective, sloooow movie about a deeply miserable main character, this was ok. This is a story about a girl who kills a man's family in a car accident and spends the rest of the movie fighting her own guilt and trying to make his life better. That's it. If you know that going into it (and are still interested) it might be a good movie. But if you're expecting a movie about ""Another Earth"", forget it, you'll get none of that here, aside from a few musings of what it all might mean to us played on radios and TV's the characters have on now and then. There are NO special effects other than ocasional shots of the other earth in the sky above ours. Calling it science fiction is a little misleading, unlike the title which is very misleading. It'd be better described as a long, drawn-out, dark episode of the Twilight Zone.",1

"It took some time to figure out how to put it on after reading other reviews about how it didn't work looped around the ring band and to just put it on first then put your ring on. I can tell you that putting the ring sizer band on first and then your ring was a big fail. It works better looped around the band and then slid the bands down your finger around the area the ring will sit, make sure the looped area on the ring is turned towards your palm side and then stretch the bands a bit to get you ring on and slide into place. The bands are comfortable but do peak out of the band, and I have a pretty wide ring. I keep tucking them back under the ring. I haven't broken one yet but my wife is on her second one already and it hasn't even been a week. I think she should have gotten a size smaller on the bands and thats why it broke. Our rings sizes fell within the size range of the large so thats what I bought. If your on the low end of that range order the next size down! I would buy a multi pack because I can totally see I'll be going through another one soon! It looks like a small tear in the band is starting.

When the woman give Agata a drink she drinks it not knowing it will change her life. Stan is out hunting and stumbles onto Agata, knowing he should just leave her and let the village people save her Stian can't seem to walk away. When Stain see's her face he knows right away she will be his wife. Waking up Agata is shocked and scared and at first thinks she is still at the festival. When reality come crashing down all Agata can think about is getting home.

But Stain will keep Agata no matter what, he has been alone for too long. The longer Agata is in this new world the more reality comes crashing down and the more both of their feeling begin to grow. But this new world isn't safe and when Agata gets the chance to finally have what she thinks she has wanted since she awakened may now be at her fingertips, now Agata will have to decide what she wants more, her home or her new life with Stian.

This was a really good read. Yes its shorter but this book wasn't rushed and I really, really enjoyed it. When I first read the book description I thought of Kristen Ashley's book Golden Dynasty and while they have a similar idea this is a story all on it's own. Stian was a great hero and like all of Ms. Snows hero's he was possessive, and strong, and me man you woman. Agata was a great heroine she didn't melt under pressure and she wasn't stupid. I also liked that she wasn't so stubborn that she missed what was right in front of her. All in all this was a really great read that was fast, hot, and new.",1

"I received a defective unit (zoom lens stopped working after an hour), and have had the replacement since December, 2015.  So far, everything is working as of February 7, 2016.  The design and features of this camera are impressive.  There are so many functions and modes that it would be hard to learn all of them, but the layout and menu are such that it is easy to access the features you will need and use, and there are 5 buttons that can be programmed to access your most used menu features.  The only ""cons"" I would mention are:
(1) There is a slight motor noise present as soon as the camera is turned on.  Panasonic says this is normal and needed to support the Image Stabilization, Focus and Zoom functions, but this noise is picked up by the built-in stereo mike during video recording modes.  I wonder about the life of a motor that's on all the time.
(2) I would like to have seen a smaller aperture setting than f8, even at the expense of slightly worse sharpness (an unavoidable consequence of physics).

The aging makeup is terrible, and James Dean performance suddenly seeems ridiculously mannered. If it had looked a good as it should, it would have helped enormously, but this is a terrible transfer. Sorry to be a spoil sport, but compared to some of the great classics from the '40's, this isn't in the same league. I'm happy that so many people still love it however.

"*Review of the Barnes and Noble book The Lord of the Rings

by Charles R. Young

Published in the May 18, 2009 issue of The New Yorker. I enjoyed this book well enough. It is a fascinating story about the lives of three young people who have been separated for over a decade. I especially liked the fact that the story is set in the past. I was quite surprised to see that the author is working on a sequel to the book, The Lord of the Rings. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fantasy or fantasy/thriller/adventure. I really enjoyed this book. I read it to a friend, and I enjoyed it very much. It is an excellent story about a family and how it all came together in the end. It is a story about a family. It is a story about a family.",0
"The overall production quality of ""Lansky"" is barely adequate. This HBO TV special comes across as a film made under severe time and financial constraints. Nonetheless, the acting talent of Richard Dreyfuss is utterly fantastic. The now middle-aged star gives a performance that ranks among his very best. Dreyfuss clearly understands this low keyed Jewish gangster who lead much of American organized crime in the previous century. The character actor Max Perlich also does a splendid job of portraying Lansky during his earlier years. Perlich is a skillful thespian who deserves greater respect and attention. He ought to have received at least an Academy Award nomination for his splendid supporting work in ""Rush.""
Meyer Lansky was something of a highly intelligent mob boss who essentially perceived himself as a misunderstood polite business man; neither better nor worse than the titans of that era's capitalist business organizations. Lansky rationalizations conveniently ignored the fact that murder and other forms of violence are not everyday realities of conventional American capitalism. Lansky, though, was probably correct to conclude that FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover and Senator Estes Kefauver hounded him mostly out of less than noble reasons.
""Lansky"" accurately depicts the Jewish gangsters as far more intelligent than those generally found in other ethnic groups. Also, the Meyer Lanskys, ""Bugsy"" Siegels, and Alfred Rothsteins were the only generation of that ethnic tradition that chose careers in organized crime. Their progeny did not follow in their father's footsteps! Meyer Lansky, for instance, made sure that his own son attended West Point and became a U.S. military officer. ""Lansky"" earns four stars. I highly recommend this movie if you are someone genuinely interested in understanding the motivations of a Meyer Lansky. He may not be an American hero, but Lansky cannot be ignored if you truly desire to comprehend the difficulties of many to assimilate into our national culture.",1

It will cost you a bit more for the materials, but you should have the right one. I have the most expensive set and have ordered a second set so far. I just can't get enough of these. Great. I like that the strap is longer than the standard ones. You can use it as a pad if you need to put a lot of weight on it. I like that it is a little thicker than my other pants. I like that it is easier to store your belt. It is more comfortable than I thought it would be. I don't have to worry about the buckle getting stuck. I like that it does not get stuck while I'm walking. I like that it does not have a strap that can be removed. The other pants I have have had trouble with it getting stuck. I have had problems with it getting stuck in the bag while I was walking. I can't say much about that because I haven't had any problems with it getting stuck. I would recommend it for those that have problems. I had this one on my bike for about 2 months. I received a replacement and it was perfect. Very comfortable.

"This book is fantastic.  It uses the best training approach, very effective.  It takes a ""dog whisperer"" style of understanding dogs and treating them with respect, understanding that the real key to dog training is to train YOU how to teach your dog.  The book is full of not only very specific and well developed training techniques, but it also goes on to give solutions and ideas if a puppy is not learning the desired skill.  I found it extremely practical, far more than other books I bought.  It corresponds and doesn't conflict with the manners and socialization classes we are taking for puppy training.  The progression of skills is very logical, allowing you to train using logical building blocks.  Getting the first series of lessons taught to puppy leads you in a logical sequence to the next chapter.  There is also a great chapter on how to resolve problems such as barking, house training, and all the nusiance behaviors (growling, jumping on your bed, etc).  Easy to read, easy to follow, and I am so happy to have found this book.  Kudos to the author.",1

The first book in the series was the prequel, ""A Moon Cracker,"" which was written by Holly Crane. I didn't really care for it, but I thought it was a great series. I love a book that starts with the most emotional, and I loved it.

I love that there was a scene with the heroine, Daisy, on a train with a group of people. I love that the heroine is a woman, but I felt like she was a little too small for her size.

"Life has not been kind to John Moon.  Depressed because his wife left him, he spends his lonely days planning a reunion that will never happen.  Living alone in a cramped, dirty trailer, he leads a hand to mouth existence.  Chronically unemployed, he has taken to poaching to put food on his table.

One morning, Moon hunts and wounds a deer.  Tracking the animal to a nearby rock quarry, he senses movement behind him.  Reacting instinctively,  he whirls and fires a single shot into the surrounding wood, and sees something brown crash to the ground.  Assuming he has downed the deer, he begins to walk towards the trees.  It is only after he is charged by the wounded deer that he realizes he must have shot something else.

When Moon investigates, he discovers the body of a young woman.  Struggling to stay calm, Moon conducts a search of  the area, and discovers the girl's belongings, along with a package containing some $80,000 in cash.  Moon, overwhelmed by events, decides to hide the body and take the cash.  Shortly thereafter, he finds himself at the center of a bizarre series of events, as the money's owners eventually trace it back to him.  Moon, unable to contact the authorities, becomes involved in a life or death game of cat and mouse with ruthless criminals who have only one goal--to get their money back at all costs.

A Single Shot is a convincing portrait of a simple man caught up in circumstances beyond his control.  Moon's anxiety and despair is palpable, and the sense of menace Jones creates is almost overwhelming at times.  Grim and macabre, this gripping saga of small town mayhem and madness will shock and disturb you.  Reminiscent of the work of Jack Ketchum and James Dickey,  A Single Shot really hits the mark.",1

"One of the best books on dreamwork I have ever read, and I have read a few. The book is not only informative, but well structured, well written, and very didactic. It is based on Jungian Psychology and therefore it does discuss a a few things about the matter, but does not enter in the different schools of dream interpretation. If you are into Jungian psychoanalysis this book os for you.

The book gives you tools to approach and interpret your own dreams and to approach and develop Visualization (Creative Imagination, as it is called here) with ease and depth.

While Phoebe is the source of all things bountiful, her purchase of the new house and the ease at which the gang made their move seemed forced. Sure, they had to get the heck out of Dodge, but establishing roots somewhere with no real investigation of the new location seemed odd. Three stars does not mean ""bad"" it just means it was an okay read.

T. E. Lawrence's work ""Seven Pillars of Wisdom"" is an early classic on guerrilla warfare by the author who trained, organized, and led Arab irregulars against the Turks in the Great War (WWI). The book, which was originally published in 1927 presents some principles of guerrilla operation which are still applicable today. Unfortunately, these principles are often lost in the author's obsession for beautiful prose.

"I love this story. All the characters and the experiences really hit me. My heart hurt when the characters were in pain and I was so happy when they were experiencing joy. I love that you become immersed and invested in all the minor characters. You want to know about them and what's going on with them through their Wishwell experience.

I loved Maddy so much. On the surface she's just a regular privileged teen but through the relationship she has with her neighbor Rachel and her family you see that she's so much more than that. She's smart and strong even when she's sad and weak.

I loved the moments in between the family. This family is full of completely different people with completely different personalities but they are all united through their love for Astrid. You can tell that each one of them would drop everything for Astrid, and that's exactly what they do when they head out on this Wishwell trip.

"I am happy with the Breeze cat box system, however it is taking some adjustment as we have 6 cats, (all rescues). Most of them get along well, as 4 of them are related, so I have luckily been able to use less litterboxes than the experts suggest, (one more litter box than you have cats). My current house is smaller than our old one, so we had to go from 5 litter boxes to 3 boxes with clumping litter. I decided to change to this system in an attempt to be cleaner overall. Because of the 6 cats to 3 boxes, I do notice a particular odor from the urine. The cats are all spayed females. I think because this is new to me, I let the pad stay too long, and I was also used to using a litter additive to counteract odor. There is of course no tracked litter all over the floor, which is great, and it is very easy to clean. None of the cats have shown any problem with the change, (I did one box at a time). I now just need to figure out which pads need changing when, based on how many cats use a particular box to urinate in. So I believe it is simply an adjustment phase. I have a feeling I will be changing these pads every couple of days, but as I said, we have 3 boxes for 6 cats. Overall I am happy with this system. I did notice that the Japanese have the same product offered with a dome cover, which would be nice. This system makes the most sense of any I have seen so far.",1

"Robert Kirkman (Author), Jay Bonansinga (Author)

Glocks = Do not have safeties.  Contrary to what you think.

Ford S10 = Umm, it was Chevrolet, not ford that made this little pickup. Ford makes the Ranger.

Stock = Rifles have stocks, Handguns have grips.

Clip = Hanguns have Magazines, a couple of models of extremely old rifles used a clip, which has an entirely different design.

Steel-Plated Revolver = Umm. What is this?  What is the steel plating? more steel? is the core lead?  Gimme a break.

These are just a few of the glaring errors with both of these authors.  They are playing in a sandbox where they know nothing, but at least they know nothing with consistency because these errors pop-up repeatedly.  Over and Over again.

I really despise lazy authors who do not at least do some research before they begin writing about something they know nothing about.  Quality material requires research guys, and this is not quality material.  There's a reason why some authors are constantly on the best seller lists, and some aren't, and this is why.

Get it right next time or stop writing.  A novel is not a comic book where your audience is in their teens and incredibly forgiving (or ignorant of such things).

You two should be ashamed of yourselves.",1
"I installed this faucet on my garage sink because of its constant use and the profile of the vertical position of the filter.  Installation is a snap and simple.  I did it with no problem and that's a bundle to say.  I waited this long to be sure the filter worked and the unit had the longevity that I expected and with each issue the unit is flawless.  My water comes directly out of the ground in the back yard, goes through about 400 feet of pumping and then another 200 feet of pipe to get it into the house before it goes into the water holder.  Whew, what a trip.  No wonder it takes rainwater over 6 months to seep down to the water level.  After the water comes into the holding system it is then sent into the house pipes upon demand.  It goes through a wound cord filter and then a charcoal filter before it finds its way to the PUR-3.  I know that's a long route and story but I wanted to be sure I gave the facts as best I could.  The PUR-3 did it's job.  It provided me with as clean a water as I could ask for.  No, it is not distilled water but it is close.  I checked it for obvious solids and other discolorations and it was as clean as I could expect because I found not the first foreign item.

I considered giving this a 5 star and did not because the amount of water coming out the faucet is significantly less than the water coming out of an unfiltered tap.  That reduced my use of the faucet from time to time such as washing the dogs or preparing water for use in cleaning paint brushes.  Removal and remounting the faucet is as easy as can be and is not an issue.  I recommend this unit without any exception and the water flow is more my problem then that of PUR.  Good drinking.",1

"With its title of ""Fat White Vampire Blues,"" I expected a wild, inventive comedy--an expectation fueled by all those ""Confederacy of Dunces"" comparisons. Well, the book is set in New Orleans and the main character, Jules Duchon, is fat, but these are about the only things Andrew Fox's novel has in common with ""Dunces."" Much of Jules behavior is whiny and annoying, which I could forgive if it was used to greater comic effect, but the laughs just aren't there. Other characters aren't much better: Maureen, another fat white vampire, is a little less irritating than Jules, if only because her appearances are in measured doses; and the antogonist, Malice X, seems an amalgamation of every movie stereotype of black men. Only Doodlebug, Jules' cross-dressing former sidekick, breaths any sort of life into this story, although even s/he can't save the flagging pace of the book's final third. ""FWVB"" isn't totally without merit: The first few chapters were engaging enough to keep me reading. Unfortunately, as the story dragged on it became quite apparent Jules is no Ignatius J. Reilly, and Fox is no John Kennedy Toole.",1
"Of the three Tunable White BR30 bulbs I bought three months ago, one is already dead.  (That's a really, really short life for an LED bulb!)

Even before that, there were a couple of flaws that really bothered me:

- Apparently, you can set the default color temperature if, and only if, you have the Sylvania hub.  I don't have the Sylvania hub; I'm using SmartThings.  With SmartThings, I'm stuck with 2700k lights (at initial power delivery); we wanted something closer to 6500k.  I don't really want to purchase a new, dedicated hub for a one-time settings pressing.  (This is absolutely a preference thing, but feel like there ought to be some other way to do this; you shouldn't have to buy a hub for a one-time use if they're going to tout compatibility with another hub!)

- Pairing mode is too easily triggered.  I have a toddler and on multiple occasions now, she's managed to put the bulbs back into pairing mode (which unpairs them from our hub).  GE Link bulbs' pairing process was an absolute pain, but we never accidentally triggered pairing with a few off/on toggles like we have with the Sylvania bulbs.

- The dimmest setting isn't as dim as Hue or LIFX bulbs (but seems to be on par with GE Link and Sengled).

- SmartThings Routines that trigger changes to brightness and color temperature sometimes only do one or the other.

Two of the three bulbs still work, but we're not really using them as smart, tunable bulbs because of the flaws listed above.",1

Apocalypse Evolution was a good story.  Its definitely science fiction with a nice apocalyptic touch.  There were a few unbelievable parts, but in science fiction, you can have totally out there things that could/would happen in certain circumstances.

"This is actually one of the best books I have read in a long time. I was just blown away by the way the author explained how to get the words to work. I can't wait to read the next one. I am on the fence about what to expect from this author. I was looking forward to reading the book, but had to wait a bit for the ending. I liked the ending, but I wish there was more. I enjoyed this book. I love how the heroine is a strong heroine. The story is very well written and I liked how she is in a relationship with her man. I like that the story is not over. I love how the heroine is a strong woman and the relationship is not over. It is a cute romance. I would recommend it. This is a good story with lots of twists and turns. I would recommend this book to anyone. I really enjoyed the book. It was a quick read. I liked that the author didn't just draw me in.",0

"Just received these boots and I've got to say, they are so cute, stylish and very comfortable.  I'm about a size 9 (although as I get older I think my feet are shrinking), so based on other reviews I ordered a 1/2 size down -- 8.5. They fit perfectly.

There's extra room in the boot but I don't feel comfortable ordering down any smaller and want to leave space for socks.  These boots look/feel as if they would hold up in snow but I've yet to try.  However, you certainly don't need to wait for snow to wear these funky boots.  In fact, your girl (me ) will be sporting them this weekend.

Weekend weather forecast and temp: sunny and mid-40s. My forecast and temp: stylin' and hot!  Highly recommend.",1

"I had seen this book before and I thought it was good enough. However, I just couldn't get into the story. There were some things I didn't like, and that made it a little difficult to understand. There were some things I didn't like, and that made it a little difficult to understand. I had to read it to understand how it all came together. This book is a must read for any young adult. I would recommend it to anyone who is into young adult fiction. I absolutely loved this book. I was just so excited to read it and read it again. It was a wonderful story. It is filled with characters that are likable and I enjoyed the way they connected to each other. I had a hard time putting it down. It was a story that I will never forget. I loved the way the story was told. I will miss the author. I will miss the author. I love this series and am looking forward to seeing where the next book comes from. I am always a fan of Julie Kingsolver's writing, and I was very impressed with this book. It was well written, and I was able to relate to the main character, who was a very good character, and the relationship between her and her father. I think this book was a great addition to a series that is often referred to as a ""coming of age"" book. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys family, mystery, mystery, romance, and historical fiction.",0
"I'm not going to talk about it, just the sound quality. If you have a full blown stereo system, the sound quality will be noticeable but the sound quality will not be noticeable. The only complaint I have is that the sound is very muddy and gets distorted. The sound is a bit muddy with the tinny sound. The sound quality is a little better than I expected. This is not a big issue for me but I have a pair of Sony dSLR speakers that I use all the time. I'm very happy with my purchase. Overall, it's a good buy. The sound quality is not great, but it's ok. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. This is a great camera for the price. I was able to find some great reviews for it, but I haven't found any good ones. I recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for a great camera for the price. I have a Nikon D7000 and it's about $300 cheaper than this. The only reason I give it 5 stars is that the cost is a bit higher than other cameras, and the pictures are much better. The camera is very easy to use and easy to use. The only drawback is that it has a little lag when you're shooting photos, which I have to take care of. However, I'm not sure if that is a problem because I'm using the camera on a tripod.",0

I wish I would have gotten the larger size.Great.  I like that the strap is longer than the waistband.  The waistband is a little too loose for my narrow waist.

We have a mini schnauzer and this works well on him. He barks and raises hell with everyone & thing in the alley. We have a privacy fence but he still challenges every body and ignores spoken commands. With the Pet Agree I can be on my deck some 40 plus feet away from the dog barking thru the fence and and give the unit just a quick tap and instantly redirect the dog's attention and stop his barking. I find he is barking at things real or imagined much less than before we got the Pet Agree. And if needed a quick tap always does the trick.,1

"Like many of us Id spent way too much time in the quest for the perfect stud finder  I own several properties and work on them myself.

Regular dry wall, dandy  you're getting solid lights every time.  Through tile, mud-bed installs, skim coat over  dry wall: not a chance.  This bad boy works.  For realz bro.  I used it to install two bathroom fans this last weekend and it was perfect.  With the skim coat its not strong enough to stick to a wall or ceiling but the stick stands up and gives you a high-five when it crosses a nail or screw.  Yes, it can take a minute of systematic swiping to find the first one and then move up and down to verify (in the ceiling it helps to know which way the joist travel).  Super happy with this.  I keep the old electronic stud finder in my bag for easy jobs but this is my go-to finder for the tough stuff.",1

I'm sure other more expensive knives are better but for someone that isn't hardcore, this is a perfect knife (thus far), It's sharp, opens smoothly, feels solid, and not expensive.

"The Spindlers has all the right ingredients. The hero forced to descend into another world to accomplish a difficult quest. So many touches are just right; the rat as Betraying Woman, the nocturni as Supernatural Advisors, etc., etc. The nocturni are especially nice, but many of her other features, for me, kind of creak. They're a bit familiar. Need to pass through three chambers to rescue someone? Gee, who's had to do that recently? Since L. Frank Baum and Dorothy rescued the Royal Family a zillion years ago in the Road to Oz. Oh, it was Harry & Co, wasn't it?

Of course, none of that matters, because the formula, the Monomyth, is just that, a formula. It's supposed to be a formula. We don't want it messed with and changed.

But we do want it to be fresh. And The Spindlers just doesn't feel very fresh. Or authentic. Our hero was just...too nice. Her relationship with her brother was just not quite plausible to me, nor did she seem to be...interesting enough to warrant being a hero. No, this book is not Coraline. It lacks the sharp, harsh humor which lends reality to newly created worlds. Too bad, because some of her inventions were vivid. The rat with no friends, the nocturni. But the journey was too much of a scramble to be fun.",1

PROS:  tried this wanting to say it was a good flashlight but it didn't work. I bought two of the same. I also bought the T20 version of this flashlight that I have had in the past.

I have not used the T20 version yet but I have tried the T20 version with the T40-6 and it has worked great. The T40-6 is not as bright as the T20 version but it is still bright enough to see if something is behind the counter. I had a few of these flashlights that I have tried but the T40-6 is very good for this kind of flashlight.

"*** This review may contain spoilers. Waking Up

by Charles Baxter

While the two have had a lot of fun together, the beginning of the movie is pretty much a family affair. It's a little more serious than some of the other Disney movies, but still a fun ride. The most memorable scene is when the kids are at school and the teacher tells them that there's nothing to do if they go to the library. They're not even allowed to go to the library. The teacher tells them that they can't go to the library if they're not allowed to go. So, they go to the library. The movie is a little too serious and the movie isn't at all realistic. I don't think I've ever seen a movie with a realistic ending. The story line is pretty good. The ending is pretty much a joke. I don't think I've ever seen a movie where a story line is completely predictable. The movie is good. The acting is pretty good. The music is good. The acting is pretty good.

"I have to say it's been years since I have felt so engaged reading a book.  Oddly, I saw the movie before buying the Kindle book; and in the middle of reading, I decided to watch the movie again.  I suspect it won't be long and I will read the book once again.

This is a thinking person's book and story, and thus isn't for everyone.  But the mastery of the writing is so highly evocative that you ""see"" the book as you read it.  Incredibly deep characters, mesmerizing continuity of theme (which some might argue about, given that the book is written as segments contributing to a ""writ large"" story), the ability to make you laugh, cry and inevitably sigh, ""yes.""

I had never heard of David Mitchell before reading this book.  But it only took me 500+ pages to realize what an important writer and artistic voice he is.

I am a strong supporter of public libraries, and have downloaded Kindle versions of books to determine if I will actually buy the book.  In the case of Cloud Atlas, it was a no-brainer.  I finished Cloud Atlas today and immediately downloaded ""Ghostwritten"" from my local library.  I suspect it won't be long and my Kindle cloud will have all of his works in it.

If you think and therefore read, and read to think, Cloud Atlas will keep your mind whirling.  It's a must-read piece of literature. It's a truly gripping story.",1

There wasn't a dry eye here. The characters were just too real. There were too many of them. There was a lot of sexual tension and then the violence was so great.

"Collar works as advertised, but I do not recommend the shock portion. Ive had other shock collars for my wild dog and bought this one as a replacement for one that ate batteries. The shock option literally burned my dogs skin and caused a sore. i did not realize until a couple of days later after i took the collar off to adjust it. I have never had this happen before with other collars and would compare it burns left by a cattle prode. Even at a low setting, my dog yelped. I am an owner who uses this to correct bad behavior, not to torture. Im pretty sad that this thing is so extreme but the vibration and noise settings are just fine.",1
"This was my first (and last) Michael Connelly book. It moved too slow. Connelly obviously knows a lot about inside workings of a police detective because the time spent on trivia was a large part of the book. There was just way, way too many words wasted describing going to work and how police procedures worked or how the hero traveled from one location to another. Or her paddle boarding. Delete it and just say she went paddle boarding and returned. I don't care about how to wax a paddle board. Or the dog that was hers but did nothing to add to the plot of the book. Why bother to have a dog in the story? Or the grandmother? Do you get my drift? There's just a lot of pointless filler in this book.

I read other reviews saying it started slowly so I gave it time to get to the action, but there really wasn't much action. I listened to the unabridged audio version, which was 9 hours 23 minutes long. If ever a book would benefit from abridging, it would be this one, but then it would only be 3 hours long.",1
I really enjoyed this story. I liked the characters and the history. The characters were well developed. I think the author will write another book about them. This is a great book.

"Would have given 2.5 starts, but the quality is just too good.

The only downside is that the range is a bit narrow.  The TV is not wide enough, so that means it takes up a lot of space.  I wish it had a bit more width for the corners.  I have a 2.5"" Sony LCD TV with a Sony projector and the Sony speakers are great.  I wish there was more on the way.

The only thing that could have improved is the sound, but I would have preferred a better sound stage.  This TV is a bit bigger than I would have liked, but it is not as big as I wanted it to be.  I would have preferred to have a wall mounted speakers.  I would have preferred a sound stage that could be the best looking in the room.  I would have liked the fact that the TV is a little longer than I would have liked.

Overall, this is a great buy and I would recommend it.  I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a Sony TV for a very reasonable price.I bought this keyboard for my daughter and she loves it.  It's a little smaller than the typical keyboard, but it's a little lighter than she expected.  It works really well for my needs and is well-made.

A lot of people who have reviewed this talk about the extenders not being attached securely enough.  I would have to assume something has been changed on the rack because mine did have a way to tighten the extenders.  I just installed this and put one of my axiom 45L panniers on it and it fit fine  I put this on my 2009 Surly Travelers Check and it seems to be sturdy I think it would hold a lot more than the listed 45 lbs (Not that you would enjoy steering your bike with anything more than that on it)  This is great for bikes like mine that did not have mid blade fork eyelets.  I would have prefered the steel Surly rack however that was 35 dollars more and the replacement fork for my Travelers Check would have been another 100 dollars.  To be clear I have not actually used this rack yet I just was stoked to find out that the rack is a lot sturdier than a lot of the reviews lead me to believe.,1
"When I saw how comfortable the model in the picture looked, I knew I had to have one. This pillow is of very high quality, is a good compromise between soft and firm (right in the middle), and is exactly as pictured.

Because it is a larger item to ship, the package was vacuum-sealed, but I had absolutely no problems getting it out and fluffing it to its full potential size. I love how the size and versatility of the pillow's opening allows you to be very flexible with your sleeping options. I am a side sleeper, so I simply adjust the other side of the pillow so that it is touching my back to create a very comfortable cocoon.

The absolute best thing about this pillow is that it stays very cool. I am in Southern California, where we occasionally see 75-80 degree weather in January, so I was very happy to find that this pillow is great at cooling and overall temperature regulation. Overall, a great purchase - this pillow has allowed me to sleep like a baby. The only bad thing about this pillow is that it is not quite as full as I would have liked it, hence my 4-star rating.

Ms Binchy expresses in the simplest of terms ... The humanness of the ordinary person. It's a fragile embrace that this writer bestows on each character.

"3.5 stars
This is skimpy set. When it is available and I can check it against the actual retail price I may update my rating. But otherwise meh. You only get round track, 3 cars, the controller and some removable decorations--it does have cool noises. I have a Marklin Z scale and an older O gauge by Lionel that I use during christmas time (obviously in different locations because near each other would be pure craziness) so I understand the train prices are more expensive than people realize, especially Engines. And this is a pretty neat and fun for little kids Engine. The Caboose is Bobber style and ok. The engine is a Lion chief Thomas the Tank and is very obviously the highlight of the set. The chirstmas hat makes it that much cuter. The remote is battery power and includes announcements and sounds but no smoke (that i could tell.) The middle freight car is nothing special and feels especially cheap, though to be fair these often do I think in part because of the open top design. The track diameter when fully spaced out is a little over 3 feet. The track is your standard Lionel rack and self stabilizes with the plastic base. With another car and 4-6 pieces of straight track this would be a neat 5 star set. As it is it just feels a little cheap. Lightweight, lots of plastic, not many cars and very small completed track.

I think most kids will love this set, and they can set it up themselves, and make train announcements--my nephew sure did--but I think parents need to understand what they're getting or they'll feel they maybe didn't get their money's worth. Its not quite the grand experience of trains of our youth. Its more plastic, less track, less cars, were bigger and we had to pay for it!",1

I currently have a wooden Lime & Lemon squeezer. That one is great for certain things that needs a bit of pulp of the Lime & Lemon. What I don't have is one of these Heavy Duty Lime & Lemon squeezer. This one has some weight to it and feels very strong in your hands. I like that there is 2 different bowl design. One for the Lime, since limes are smaller than the Lemon. And the other bowl for the Lemon. For some people, that is just extra work and troublesome when using it. I find it very useful and smart that they also made to color coded to match.

Now to use this properly, you MUST place the Lime or Lemon with the expose side, facing DOWN. This is how the squeezer works by pushing the Lime or Lemon down, causing it to flip inside out, so the juice can come out to the bottom of the squeezer. I know it looks like you should place the Lime or Lemon with the expose side facing up to match the squeezers shape but that will not work and Lime or Lemon juice will splash everywhere and there won't be that many juice coming out of it.

"Ever season of Beauty and the Beast has woven its spell around me a different way. In the first season, we learn of the development of Catherine and Vincent's relationship, as well as being introduced to the wonderful people Below. In the second season we saw the two hero's love fourish and the different trials and tribulations they had with separation issues, and Vincent's internal demons.

The third season, in my opinion, is what really shines out of the entire series. While there are only 12 episodes, the excellent writing and story arcs completely make up for it. Ron Pearman is at his best as Vincent. Really, in my opinion, his best acting the entire series. You also really get to know more about what makes people tick ""above"" and how Catherine really touched everyone she met.

You gain more respect for Eliot Burch, Cathy's on-off boyfriend from earlier times. Joe Maxwell gets a real backbone, and I kind of disliked him at times. New character Diana certainly does NOT take Catherine's place, and her and Vincen't relationship is far from being a romantic one. I have read in places that she seems to have some sort of paranormal powers, but I have not seen that in the episodes I have watched so far. She seems to have excellent insticts and investigative skills.

Now the character Gabriel, man I love to hate this guy. He's just pure evil incarnate. You can tell that Vincent's son is sensitive to him, because every time Gabriel is in the room it seems the child gets distressed.

A couple plot elements have gotten me a little confused so far, but it is negligible at this point, and I am hoping is cleared up by the time I watch the last episode.",1
I loved it and want more. The characters were well developed and kept my interest. I recommend this book.,0
"I rather like the padding, it feels good and comfortable.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic part is very hard to put on. The material is thick and it is hard to get on your head. I wish it was thicker.The pump does not work as well as I expected.  I have had to replace it with a new one.  I just went with the old pump.  The new pump works great.This is a great tool for camping or backpacking. The mount is very secure, and it is well built. This tool is super lightweight and lightweight. I have used it a couple of times in the field. It is very easy to use and to assemble. It does not interfere with the wind or rain. I highly recommend this tool.This is the best looking sight for the money.  It does the job and does it really well.  The only problem I have is that it does not have a rear sight mount.  I just needed something to mount on my Magpul G26.  The mount does not have a front sight.  The mount does not mount on a M4.  I don't have any problems with this sight.  The only negative is that it does not have the front sight mount.  I have been using this sight on my M4 and M4A1.  It is very difficult to mount the rear sight.  I also have had problems with the front sight not having the mount.  This is a very poor sight.  I would not recommend this sight to anyone.  I bought this sight for my Ruger",0

"The video under certain lighting conditions has the faintest sound of a computer speaker, but the sound is so strong that the computer speakers look like they're running out of speakers.  This is a bit of a problem in the low light environment.  This was an excellent product.  I recommend it to anyone with a computer.Works great.  Well made.  Cheap enough to use for my kid.  I highly recommend it to anyone who needs an external hard drive for their PC.I bought this for a friend, but he does not like it.  He just likes it and loves it.  I like that it has a feature where you can turn it off on the iPad and on the keyboard.  However, it does not have the desired feature.  I will update this review if I find the feature.

UPDATE:  I found this to be a very good buy.  I have had it for a couple of days now and it is still working great.  I just wish it had a way to charge it.  I don't like it when I have to charge it.  I will update the review if I find the feature.

"I saw The Suitor at the Sacramento French Film Festival this year, and bought the whole collection for the Sacramento Alliance Francaise.  Pierre Etaix has a deadpan comedy style much like Buster Keaton or Harold Lloyd.  Some of his film, like The Suitor, could easily have been silent films.  The set includes all of Etaix's films, including his last, a documentary about the French during summer vacations.  It was this film that so outraged the French that Etaix was never able to make another film in France.  He meant it as a comedy, but the French thought he was making fun of them.  One of the long films, The Great Love (Le Grand Amour) starred his wife at the time as his wife.  The film Yoyo takes place over decades, with Etaix playing both father and son depending upon the decade.  In the years before 1928, the film is silent.  The film becomes a talkie only when the action takes place after talkies were invented.",1

"I saw this movie in theaters and I thought it was great. It was thought-provoking and you see this different side of the handi-capped. The documentary is very touching and uplifting and it's definitely worth seeing. I think it's very truthful and it's only graphic in a few scenes. I don't think it's a movie worth seeing again and again, so maybe you should just rent it instead of buying. Some of the stories in the film are so heartfelt and you really do feel for these guys. There's tons of emotion and in the end, you can't help but feel that there's a bright side to everything.",1

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it's a bit small, but if you're a professional photographer or just want a little extra storage, I'd suggest getting some.

It's also not the best laptop. I have a laptop that I use all the time and I think the keyboard is a bit weak. This is not a big deal for me, because I'm not very interested in that type of typing.

Overall, I would recommend this to anyone looking for a laptop that's a little more portable.I like that it has a feature where you can turn it off for less than 10 minutes and it does a good job of keeping it charged. It also charges my phone and tablet. I wish it had the",0
"This bag is great. I have all kinds of bike bags because none really worked that well for my needs. They were either, two small or inconvenient to use. This one has a tremendous amount of space without using the expansion. It is also shaped well so it doesn't interfere with pedaling. ie your thigh doesn't hit it. Not only do I have the normal tools but I have put my big ass kryptonite chain and lock in the bag, all without using the expansion and I still have room to put a wallet and keys in there! I never use exclamation points by the way. The mounting/compression straps and connectors work well. It seems durable as well. It is so great that I plan to buy two more for other bikes.",1

"Alright, my fat cat isn't the smartest and hasn't figured out how to open the compartment. I do love not getting kitty attached (meow'ed excessively) anymore because she knows that at a certain time the noise comes and she eats. I just wish it was for a full 7 days to make it easier for me to remember to fill it. The numbers are at the bottom of each 1 cup section but black on black is hard for me to see. I've had it for almost a month and my cat was eating out of it in a few minutes the first day, the 2nd day almost no hesitation and after than, she sits quietly by it up to an hour before the timer opens the compartment and as soon as it starts to shift, she's eating. I really like the recording feature. I think it really helped the first 2 days but she doesn't need it anymore.",1
"I bought the PIF00 primary kit and the extra transmitter for my Shepard. I bought the extra transmitter due to the large yard.
The items (other than the test light) themselves appeared to be quality construction.
When I started putting out the flags, using the test light was hit or miss.  I'd plant a flag then move back and start heading outward again 10 to the side.  In some places the circumference was ok.  On others, it wasn't equidistant from the main unit (I started with the single main unit).  So, when the circle was done, I had a semi circle of flags with some at a different radius than others.  While that would have been ok - the dog would just have a non perfect circle...  However, when I went back to check again, the test light lit up at different radii than the original layout.  Basically, the dog might get zapped at a location today where he was fine yesterday.  Not something I'm willing to risk.
The test light has 2 thin wire contacts that started to bend and in my opinion would eventually break.  I had to wiggle the test light on the collar's contacts to make sure they touched.
Your mileage may vary if you buy and deploy this system.
The return process was smoother than I expected.  So hopefully if you try this product (great system and I may have received a bad test light) and it doesn't work, it's not $600 down the drain.",1

"These are heavy duty tubes. I did not expect them to be as thick as they are and I mean they are thick. I installed these tubes on two of my bikes so far but haven't had a chance to go for a long ride yet. But I didn't have any problems with installation. I removed the original tubes and installed these and I used one of the ORIGINAL tubes as a spare in case I do have a flat. I would not use one of these as a spare as they are about the weight of three regular tubes combined.

 I have a Burley trailer that uses 20x1.75 tubes and even ordered tubes for it as I don't want any flats. And even if I do these are so thick that I could probably run the tires flat and still keep going.

I was leary about ordering these at first but at this time I am very please with this product. Just take your time and make sure that the tire seats itself properly on the rim and I would recommend these to others and I will also update my review of them after I get some miles on these tubes.

Since these tubes are so thick and heavy it might take some more effort to pedal because of the rotational force that is involved. I don't think I would use these on my road bike because of that. But for the commuter bike that I plan on riding to work (7 miles one way) or the bike for pulling by trailer it won't matter that much to me. I don't want to fix a flat. If you are planning on riding a long distance (10 to 20 miles or more) stay with the lighter tubes and just carry a spare tube in case you have a flat.",1

"I'm very disappointed in this drive, as even with large files I can't write faster than 80MB/sec on a USB 3.0 port. But I don't think it's the drive's fault, as it's capable of much faster speeds and other people get those speeds.

The issue with these very fast USB 3.0 drives is that their speed is very much affected by the chipset being used, and the chipset drives. I am using a 2yr-old ASUS motherboard and it uses the ASMedia USB 3.9 chipset. It's a highly regarded chipset but it came out after the NEC/Renasys (sp?) and drivers seem optimized for the latter.

The odd thing is that I bought a 32 GB SanDIsk Extreme (not the Pro version, as this is new) last year and it's blazingly fast on the same port on the same computer, so I would have expected this to be at least that fast.

One thing to mention: These are expensive drives and the 32 GB Extreme was and still is expensive. The competition 3.0 drives have dropped but not the SanDisk Extremes, which I think is fair as they are so much faster. (I have a couple of other brands USB 3.0 flash drives and they are laughably slow compared to the SanDisks.)  However, what stunned me about the Extreme series, given the price, was how incredibly cheaply made they are. They are made of the crummiest plastic you can imagine and I'm sure I could squeeze and shatter it pretty easily.

With this new Extreme Pro series, there's still some of that, and these are far more physically delicate drives than other brands (esp given the price) but they don't feel quite as delicate as the Extreme series.",1

I am so excited to get my hands on the next book in this series.  It is definitely a must read for me.  I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.I loved this story. It was a good read and I was able to read it in one sitting. I was going to buy the other two books but when I got them I couldn't put them down. It was good read.I really enjoyed this book. The characters were good.

"Jason went from enlisted to national security, and then went into a period of financial crisis. The other two authors had a similar view. The basic idea of the book is that we are going to look at the circumstances in a particular situation. This is a very good idea, but it is not a good one. The book is very well written and well presented. I was quite surprised to see that Mr. N. M. DeMille, the author of the book, wrote about how the crisis affected the economy, and how it affected the country. He went into detail about how the crisis affected the economy, and how it affected the nation. I found that this book was a good read. It is not a perfect read, but it is a good read. It is very informative, and I enjoyed reading it.",0

This is a great product and I highly recommend it.I use this as a hiking pack.  The first time I used it I was going to use it as a backpack and I was so excited to use it.  This pack has a lot of storage.  I have a camera, a camera that I have in my pocket, a small camera, a camera that I have in my backpack.  It has a lot of pockets for things you can carry.  There is also a small storage pouch that I can carry my phone, my keys, my watch, my camera, and my water bottle.  I also have a camera bag that I have in my backpack.  The camera is pretty small, but it fits the camera perfectly.  I also use it for a hiking backpack as well.  The material is good.  The material is soft and comfortable.  The color is very well-made.  It is very bright.  The strap is a little tight on my belt.  I also have a few loose pockets on the top, but it is not a problem.

I will say, the strap is very light.  I think I will order a size smaller, but for my purposes, it fits fine.  I haven't tried the strap on the back side yet, but I will update",0

Unfortunately, that was not the case for me. It is sadly just not suited for my body. On me - it lets all of the wrong things hang out (I'll upload a photo to show what I mean). Fit wise, for the most part it did fit me as it should, even the breast area provided appropriate coverage. I just was not at all comfortable in this suit. I still gave it 3 stars because the return process was fast and easy. I won't say that there is anything wrong with this suit because as I stated the other reviewer looks fantastic in it and she says she feels great in it. Guess it's just not for everyone!!",1

"We got this dollhouse for my grand daughter.  She loved it.  It's been a great addition to her collection.  She loves to play with her dolls.  She's been taking it out and putting it back in.  I wish it had a little more furniture for the little ones to play with.  I also wish the plastic was a little more solid.  I wish there were more lights and sounds.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it's very small.  You'd think it would be too small for our little ones to play with.  The dollhouse is definitely bigger than I expected it to be.  It's also made of wood that is easier to store.  I'm not sure if the wood is going to be durable, but it's sturdy enough to keep my grand daughter entertained for a long time.  I don't know if the wood is going to last as long as I thought it would, but it's definitely made of wood that will last for years to come.  I'll update this review when I find more wood for my daughter's collection.My nephew was very happy with this.  He loved it!  He loves it!

We have been using them for a few weeks now and it has lasted for hours!  We love the colors and the size and the size of the rubber bands. They hold up well for a long time.

He is much smaller than I thought he would be, he looks cheap, his facial features are not placed in a way that looks normal, his head was not sewn correctly so it is crooked and smashed on one side. I kept him because my child specifically asked Santa for this character in a doll or stuffed version and I couldn't find another of any kind of this character.  My child loves him with all of his imperfections so it was not a waste of my money. The material and stitching are sturdy and he has held up very well with being handled and a constant companion to my child.

The second part is about the two wolves who are a part of the story and the man who is one of the wolves.  I loved that part.

If the window has even slight residue, those suction cups do pop off. As for the top suction cups, there are two parts.

"While struggling to find an adjective to describe this book - the word that sprang to mind was 'childish'.
It reads like the author read a book entitled 'How to write a novel' - then tried to cram all the 'hints' into this book.
The plot is (basically) OK - but the telling of the tale is infantile.
The reader could constantly feel that the author was 'talking down' to them.
Many of the scenarios and occurrences are truly laughable (laugh-out-aloud laughable) in their improbability.....
Then there's the annoying - and silly - open-ended 'ending' ---- leaving the entire rationale of the tome unexplained.",1
"Got this 4 days ago, so far so good. I bought this for my husband who has developed allergies in the last year. We have two long haired cats and a 85 pound Lab. His allergies were so bad last week he woke up short of breath and couldn't sleep. I let this run on high for 6 hours the first day, then switched it to medium the first night. I turn it off when we wake up and switch it on an hour or two before bedtime. My husband has been able to sleep through the night and wakes up rested. He is also much less congested so his snoring has reduced which was a huge bonus for me. The meduim setting may take getting use to for some. I have a white noise sleep machine (to block out the snoring) and it is a little louder than that. It doesnt bother us but we are use to it. The quiet setting is even quieter than my sleep machine. I would definitely recommend this for anyone that suffers from pet allergies and doesnt want to have to shave or give up thier beloved pets. I also bought an allergy pillow cover and that may be contributing as well.",1

"Jeff Dunham world tour special All Over The Map I watch with an open mind based on what people said about the product.  For me personally I found his special to be enjoyable, lots of good facts about all the places the tour took place.  I also found all the characters were very funny in all the countries even when the rules were very strict about certain things said on stage.  The DVD does give you a choice of bleep and unbleep so for those like myself and my family we enjoy the uncensored version of all his specials. Which of course fully uncensored specials is five out of seven specials which I now own this one.  I normally do give away any spoilers about DVD'S but those with families, the unbleep version has walter dropping alot of F words on stage during the preformance.  But like said before the special is actually very good if you watch with an open mind and enjoy all the extra's of how they flim it which is what alot of people complain about.  I didn't find it to be an issue at all with the special still funny and made me almost cry from laughing so hard rib cage still hurts today.",1

"Zoe Michaels lives with her boyfriend, Chase Hilliard, and their two best friends, Brody McNamara and Tate Winslow. Zoe and Chase have an extraordinary sex life and often shared their most sensual sexual fantasies at night. After Zoe creates one of Chase's fantasies for his birthday, he decides to reciprocate with a fantasy involving additional men. He involves Brody and Chase in the adventure.

The title of the anthology (this story is included in Four Play) is appropriate for this story as it involves the relationship between the Zoe, Chase and their two roommates. It goes well beyond a menage scenario as they continue to explore other fantasies. Chase and Zoe are completely uninhibited but the relationships begin to strain after a while.

It's well written and the complexity of the characters make it interesting beyond the sexual exploits. This is as sexually explicit a story as I've ever read so take that as a warning if that makes you uncomfortable. The emotional strains placed on each of them will surprise you and draw you into the story. It is well done.

Note that characters from Seducing Simon appear in this story.",1
"Nice magnifier for the price.  I looked at 3 brands when shopping.  Eotech , Vortex and Sightmark.  The Eotech is great but it is way out of my price range.  The sightmarks action to move it out of the way felt cheap and was not very fluid.  The Vortex went on sale for 159 which was a bargain.  The VMX-3T flips out of the way with a simple button movement.  Can easily be done on the fly one handed.  I like the way it feels.  The magnifier is very clear and works great when paired with a Eotech 512.  It comes with a hight spacer so that you can raise it a smidge if it is to low.  You can fully adjust where it is pointed through the side and top adjustments (like any scope).

The one down side which I find on all scopes if your eye is not at the right distance it shrinks the field of view.  I did not find this to bad in shooting with it though.

I have not used there warranty service but it covers everything except theft and intentional damage for the lifetime of the product.

""From Hell"" is a series of episodes that chronicle the lives of a group of people living in a small town in the middle of nowhere. It features a large cast of characters. This is a very good series. The episodes are very interesting and the stories are very interesting. I think this is one of the best series I've seen in a long time. I recommend it to anyone interested in horror and to those who want a good series. I know that many people who are interested in this series will be disappointed. I know that some people will find it boring and to me that is what I like about it. However, I think that I can tell you that I enjoyed it.",0

"Great stove. Easy to clean (when needed). Easy to maintain in the field. Parts are plentiful everywhere in the world. This stove will burn just about any fuel you want to put into it, though I don't suggest kerosene or gasoline. I bought this stove and used it faithfully for 20 years. I updated my stove recently to a Snow Peak Giga-Power with auto-ignite. Despite loving my new stove very much, I keep this stove and still use it from time to time on cold day hikes to boil water for tea. It has NEVER failed me in over 20 years no matter what I put it through.

If you are looking for lightweight backpacking stove and you may be traveling with a few people or overseas this may be a great choice for you.

If you want less weight and don't mind a slightly longer boil time (per qt), go with the Giga-Power with auto ignite by Snow Peak. The fuel canisters are readily available at most backpacking stores or online. I can boil water for tea (for myself) and all 3 meals for 3 full days and nights on one of the small canisters (8oz. or so) in moderate to fair weather. They weigh less than the liquid fuel+bottle you would be carrying with the MSR Whisperlite. Still a great stove hence the 5 star rating.",1

"I do not own this rifle but am open to purchasing one.  The reviews are very positive, but some reviewers mention 'barrel-droop.'  Amazon even sells a device to bolt onto the gun to mitigate 'barrel-droop' so this must be a real issue. Reviews of other manufacturers' guns do not mention 'barrel-droop' so I can only conclude that RWS has an issue other manufacturers do not.

But if this is such a great gun, why does one have to purchase an extra device to mitigate what appears to me to be either a design issue or a manufacturing defect?  I would love to hear a real explanation from an expert.  Until then, I will postpone any purchase decision.

Best regards.",1
"I initially mounted this scope on my AR, and have used it in about half a dozen outings. I found that I was really fighting with it, usually spending a good amount of ammo on constantly sighting and fixing. I will say, it is what it is, an under $100 scope, that I attempted on a .223 platform. There are hundreds of reviewers here that have been happy with this setup on an AR, but it just didn't work for my use (150 yards or less, mostly 100). When it was on, it was on. It just never stayed. You really need to have a strong understanding of MOA, scope centering and sighting, field of view, point of impact, etc, but especially with the cheaper scopes, as the adjustments will be crude and course. With higher end optics, the settings and adjustments are smooth and precise. I was able to mount this to my son's 10/22, and hopefully that will be an appropriate application. So if you are considering this for an AR, (just my 2 cents), there are plenty of lower cost options available slightly above the low end UTG products that offer much more.",1

"I really like this product.  My 9lb pomeranians fit compactly within.  It looks a bit snug for them to sit up but it's workable.  The product is very versatile and we've already used them a few times.

Now that we've had this for a while, I'd like to add a few things.  We bought two.  We use these as car seats.  The first trip, I put them up high so the dogs could look out the windows.  It didn't go well.  The dogs wanted to jump out and play around so it was a bit of a mess.  Now, I set them on the seat.  I put a towel on the bottom to keep the dogs cozy.  I clip their harnesses to the inner leash and adjust it so they are free to move around but unable to jump out of the seat.  These adjustments have made for much more pleasant traveling.  They ride with the mesh door down and sometimes with it zipped shut and both are well tolerated.

When taking them out to the car, I roll one and I back pack one.  I find that both options work well.  I wouldn't want to roll one long, treacherous distances or do too much backpacking but it works for getting them in and out.  As previously mentioned, I sit the traveler directly on the seat and seat belt them in but when I hung it up higher using the headrest, it worked well and seemed stable.

The pockets allow for leashes.  That's about it.  It's not big enough to store toys or food or whatever.

I was looking for a ""go light"" quality built camera with lot of features and adjustments.  It came down to the Panasonic Lumix G-3 or Olympus Pen.  The Panasonic won the contest because it has both and high quality LCD screen AND a high quality viewfinder (although it is electronic not optical.)  In addition the LCD screen folder out and rotates270 degrees which is a very handy feature.  If you want a smaller 4/3 camera and are happy with just the LCD (no viewfinder) the Olympus may be a bit better camera.  The G-3 is much much lighter and smaller than my Canon 5D.  The only serious limitation is with the available reasonably priced lenses, the are relatively slow compared to more expensive 35mm camera lenses.

"Almost everyone from ""Stormriders"" is a Star Trek fan, and I'm not one of those people. But I am a Star Trek fan. The basic premise of the movie is that the crew of a space ship in the 21st century is infected by a virus that gives them the ability to control their own behavior. As they become infected, the crew become increasingly violent and insane. As the infected crew becomes more violent and insane, they become more violent and insane. The movie begins to get a little slow, but as it goes on, it becomes more realistic. The aliens seem to be having a blast, and it's kind of scary that they get on the ship and are able to control their behavior. It's a nice twist to the story. It's also a little hard to figure out who the good guys are. In the first movie, the bad guys were pretty bad. I guess this movie was trying to be a bit of a sci-fi horror movie, but it was a little too dark for me. I was hoping for a more more ""serious"" twist, but it just doesn't work. I don't think this movie is worth watching if you're a Trek fan. I would recommend it if you're a Trek fan. Also, if you're a Trek fan, you'll probably like the movie. This movie is a must see.",0

"Silly me, I figured that after so many reviewers' complaints about  Hutch being stuck behind a desk in the last couple novels, the author was going to make his (and Priscilla's) many fans happy by writing a story of her early years.  Made sense to me, as it seemed an easy way to get our favorite female star ship pilot back in the pilot's seat and give us an exciting and engrossing story, like the first awesome books in this series.

But no, I was wrong.  As soon as Hutch graduates and receives her pilot's license, the author puts her...wait for it...behind a desk.  Really?  I waited 2 years and paid $11 so I could see her behind a desk again?  Oh, sure enough, later on she does get to fly again, but not as the ""pilot in charge"" and she never gets to do anything even remotely interesting, much less daring or exciting.  For the most part, any time she's flying it's under the command of someone else, and it's the someone else that makes the decisions comes up with the solutions to the problems of the day.  Hutch's presence adds virtually nothing to the story; it would be the same if Joe the no-name boring starship pilot took her place.

Let's try to be clear: Mr. McDevitt - We LOVE the old Hutch, the one in the pilot's seat.  The one who explored strange new worlds, who made decisions, who took risks; the one without whom all would be lost.  PLEASE bring her back.  I think if you write one more ""Hutch behind a desk"" story I may have to give up on you.",1

Then: Kind of an odd feel when you are toweling off (I used it after a swim)...in part because it lacks that certain degree of heft you have come to expect from a towel, and in part because it has a microfiber ""tackiness"" for lack of a better word. If you have ever dried your hands on a microfiber cloth, you know what I mean.

Finally: overall, it is a very absorbent, very soft, very well-made towel. Absolutely perfect for a gym bag because it packs down to the size of a water bottle.",1

The first book in the series, the Bride of the Bride, is the first of the three in the series. It is told from the perspective of a young woman. This book is a great introduction to the story. It is a quick read and will make you feel the emotions of the characters.

The main characters, Cara and Ethan, are on a journey with a group of people who have been close to each other for years. They have been together since they were little. They have a great connection, but have a different way of talking about it. They have a lot of issues, but they are able to overcome them.

This book is about Cara and Ethan. Cara is a single mom, Ethan is a single father who is raising a son in a small town. Cara is a single mom who is dealing with a loss. Ethan is a single father who is dealing with",0

"I'm very happy with these inexpensive manifolds. However, my crimper does not fit once the first line is crimped on (copper rings). I have a custom made threaded-bolt crimper that I bought from eBay - it's a life saver and fits perfectly into these small manifolds. The guy makes them on a CNC machine. The bolt crimper requires you to tighten two heavy duty bolts with a socket wrench but it allows you to get into tight spaces like this manifold and has cutouts for 1"", 3/4"", 1/2"" and 3/8"" - that's a lot of tool for like $40.

"I was pleased to order this knowing it was highly reviewed, pleased to feel the weight of the small box it came in, then very skeptical when I opened the box.

This is easy to assemble and might be confusing when you consider that it comes with 16x the amount of screws needed for any TV.  However, all you will need are the 4 nuts, 8 small allen head screws and 4 acorn nuts and you can assemble it in 5-10 minutes reusing the original screws on the back of your TV.

After quick assembly, I mounted them on my new 70"" Vizio E70 that weighs around 70 pounds and thought that the legs might not be sturdy enough.  After placing the TV on my smallish TV stand, the legs somehow feel like they transfer the weight of the TV to the bottom center and the TV feels very stable.

This is a 5 star rating because it can be a permanent solution for anyone out there that needs to mount a large TV on a small stand, it costs so little, and it feels very secure!",1

"There is nothing like the return of the dragon/Satan in the form of a Tiamat cult. People (mostly dirty topless women) are becoming possessed across the world at an alarming rate. But don't worry, the Vatican was three priests who bombed out of drama class, so you know their good. Father Jan (Rudy Barrow) who had basic exorcism training, teams up with epidemiologist Daryl Lux (Liz Mente Bishop) who doesn't seem to like clothes. They are given all the creature comforts of a small trailer in a field to save the world because this is a low budget film.

This is a film you can take a nap in the middle and wake up and you haven't missed anything. The scenes are too long and there are too many scenes of possession, apparently wishing to cast every local gal willing to get dirty and take her blouse off. The back of the DVD gives out plot spoilers...if such a thing is possible.

The DVD is poorly made as the extras started right when the film was over, hence the deleted scene came on at the end of the feature as if it was a part of it. A bit confusing, but the nudity was nice.

It not only shows how great characters change -- Asajj Ventress and Quinlan Vos -- but also how the entire Jedi Council is evolving downward. The beginning chapters show how far the Jedi Council has moved from a worldview of pure good vs. pure evil to one where questionable tactics are both considered and chosen. Obi Wan makes a great supporting character here. Anakin Skywalker is even more in the background, but considering his own romance (i.e. in Jedi terms, emotional attachment) with Padme, I'm sure he was taking notes from the relationship of Quinlan Vos/Asajj Ventress.",1

Our cat took a leap on top of it ONCE (never again) and the top pole is noticeably bent.  Granted, it's not supposed to be jumped on; in hindsight, the cloth tent is not a good option for cats that are naturally going to jump on surfaces.  Also, the sides of the litterbox lid get stuck on the sides of the tent so opening the lid is not smooth.  The window at the back of the tent that is supposed to allow you to get to the buttons and settings is a joke.  Not only is it difficult to see what the settings are, but there's no way you can stick your hand into the tent AND see what you're doing at the same time.  It does allow the cord to be plugged but there's no other benefit to the window.  I haven't decided what we will try next but this purchase is a bust.",1

""This Is Mine"" by Roy Glenn...

What I liked about this novel....

There is nothing I can say that can top saying this was anther well written captivating novel about Mike Black by this author. I simply loved the fact that Mike and Shy marriage is strong, Ms. Jada knows that Mike will not ever be hers so she can do what she does best and that is make money. Oh yes ....Wanda is back and Bobby is doing what he does best and that is being Bobby. I loved how this author was able to bring out all about Mike's father and family. Wow, how they were so alike in mores ways than one. Now, that will be interesting to see how this saga will turn out. The only thing left to say is that we the readers will be waiting waiting for the next great installment to the Mike Black Series.",1

I would recommend it to anyone who likes to read about love and a good friendship.I have read most of the books written by this author, and this is one of my favorites.  There is a lot of science and mystery that is well-paced and kept my interest.  I was very disappointed that this book was given to me for free.

"Maybe if you have a dog with a wide mouth you might need to make a small change. I think it's a good idea to have some guidelines when it comes to how much food you should give your dog. Some people think it's ok to give some food to your dog and others say it's ok to give them a treat. If you have a dog with a long mouth or a sensitive stomach, I think that's fine. If you have a dog that's sensitive to eating something that is hard to digest, I'd suggest changing that up a bit. I've found that having a dog with a sensitive stomach is not as important to your dog as having a hard body and to a dog that is sensitive to eating something that is hard to digest. My dog also likes some of the soft treats she gets but she doesn't like the soft ones.",0

They both sound great.  I am very pleased.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought for my TV. I did not want to have to replace it since the TV was so cheap. It works well and seems to last for quite a while. It's very easy to use and holds the TV securely. The only con I've noticed is that it has a small gap where it attaches to the wall. I haven't seen it in action yet. I would recommend it to anyone.I have been using a gb12x2 for about a year and have had no problems.

It really is a high quality game with wooden pieces that are a great size for preschoolers to handle. The cards progress in difficulty, and it's quite impressive how many challenges there are using only four pieces. Very clever and perfect for quiet play!",1
"I have UAG cases for my iPhone and iPad mini. Given my positive experience with them, it was a no-brainer to get one for the iPad Pro. Their version for the 9. 7"" model is attractive, light, but well-engineered, useful, and protective like all the UAG cases I own. I like the dark blue because it isn't another all black case but it isn't an overly flashy color either. I like to cruise just under the radar but still have some style. ;)

Functionally, the case fits well, all ports and buttons are easy to access, it is well protected both opened and especially when closed, and the FrogSkin cover is easy to grip and simple to clean. The cover is easily adjustable and the stand can be detached, it is compatible with a keyboard, it has a ""Smart"" cover to put the device in sleep mode, and there is a stylus holder (see photo). It is fairly light given it's size and doesn't add as much bulk as one might think to your iPad Pro. All in all, this is another fantastic case/cover from UAG. I did receive a complimentary unit for an unbiased review, but honestly they would have been my first choice for purchase anyway. They have a loyal customer in me though I would be sure to let you know if they dropped the ball in any way with their products.",1
Got one of these for each of the kids and for my husband and I.  We all love them.,1

I have a couple of other tools that I use to keep in my tool bag.  I have a portable ladder, which can be attached to the ladder, and the ladder is very comfortable.  I have used it to hold my tools and cordless drill bits.  I have had no problems with the ladder.  I am very pleased with this purchase.

You can't beat the price for this product.  It's not as expensive as a company like Gerber, but it does a good job of keeping you organized and organized.  I had a few issues with it, but the only thing I have was that I had to turn it off and on,",0
"This fan is so light that it doesn't feel like it will last for a long time. It is so small that it's not worth risking damaging the plastic part.

It is a good value for the money.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought for my TV. I did not want to have to replace it since the TV was so cheap. It works fine and I can't tell you how much better it is than the old one.I bought this for a friend and she loves it.  I haven't had any problems with it.  I am happy with it and recommend it to others.This is a great product, I use it on my new iPod Touch. I can not think of a better deal for it.  It has a good sound, but I have no problems with it.

This float is big...in a good way. It's very sturdy and holds my 4 1/2 month old son very well. He likes the toys that are included but I stick the foam ones on the side of the shower wall during his bath to help entertain him. They also help me to teach him a few primary colors. The canopy is adjustable and keeps the sun off of him nicely. Well worth the money.,1
"We received a early copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review.

Talon and Gretchen's book was a wonderful read. The characters are well thought out and all blend together to form a great story. I didn't read the first book in this series but it definitely wasn't necessary to this story. Gretchen travels back to her hometown to try to figure out what has happened with her father. While there, she meets Talon and the sparks fly from there. I would recommend this book to those that like reading a paranormal/shifter type series with familiar characters but who also like books that you don't have to necessarily read in order. I will definitely be looking for future books from this author.

"To be honest, I thought this was a different trick I've seen elsewhere, but the general concept is the same.  The one problem is this is not a trick you can do close up or in high illumination.  The gimmick is very visible and identifiable.  Also, if you have big hands like I do, let's just say this trick is not for you.  It's made for people with small hands.  So I would have to say I was disappointed with the product.  It would be nice if these drawbacks were clearly stated in the product description.",1
Great for grown ups kids and a whole bunch of fun for adults.greatThis movie was one of the worst movie,0
"I loved the way these two characters meet and fell in love. Their story was so sweet until it all fell apart. Years later, they are still in love but can't admit it or find their way back together. There are so many possible perpetrators in this story that it was close to the end before I could figure it out. I love stories that can do that. The ending was super special and went right back to their beginnings. It was a great story, and I can't wait to read the next one.",1
"Everything you need in one of these cases.  Not too big or too small.  Works great.  Great price.Works great.  The sound is great.  I used this with a 50"" AM/FM radio, and it worked great.  I used it for a long time before",0

"Julie Taymor's highly stylized, complex, and believable character, which is a nice touch for the movie.

The movie is a lot of fun to watch, and the actors are very believable.

The movie is in English, which is one of the most important languages in the world.  The English subtitles are also very good, which is great for me.

I highly recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys a good story and a good script.Love this movie!  A must have for any young couple, or anyone who loves the kids.  I recommend it to everyone.  My favorite part of this movie is when it comes to the great acting.  I was very impressed with the acting by everyone involved.  It is a great movie to watch for any family.  Love it!This is a very good story with good acting.  The story is pretty good, but not as good as the first movie.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes good stories and good",0
"The heart rate function works fine. The only problem is that it takes a little getting used to.

I had to replace the crank with a different one, so it should work better.

The only problem is that it requires a little tightening.

The crank should also be a bit smaller than I wanted it to be.

I would recommend this if you are looking for a cheap replacement for a crank that is on a different brand.

I will update if I find another one.

Update: I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review and unbiased review.I used this for a couple of months and it did the trick.

Another Great Weldon Brothers series. It was great how Nan was able to get Jackson to not give up on his life. I enjoyed their story and how things turned out for the two of them and the bundle of joy that they had. I will be recommending the book to my family and friends to read.,1
"Very good product. BUT, it is a very thin piece of plastic that is hard to remove. If you want to remove it, you have to put a piece of plastic in the center of it and then screw it in. Otherwise, it's very thin. I received a 2nd one at a discount in exchange for my honest review. Thank you. We love this set. I love the color and the size. We are very happy with our purchase.

He wears a size 7 and a size 8. I ordered a large and it fits perfectly. He has already been wearing it for a few months now and it is still holding up well. I am very pleased with this purchase. My son is a size 8 and this is perfect!  He is 6'1"" and it fits him perfect. The material is soft and comfortable. I am very pleased with this purchase. Very comfortable and my son loved it!Bought this for my husband and he was very pleased with it. He is a 36D and wears a medium. I love the color and the fit. It's a nice looking shirt, but not for a 38D. The only negative thing is the material is very stretchy. The fabric is very thin and it would be more comfortable if it were stretchy. It's also very thin and not very comfortable. The only negative thing is the material is very thin and not very comfortable. I would not recommend it for anyone. This is a good quality wallet. I wear it everyday, and it is a perfect fit. It is very lightweight and it has a very solid outer shell.",0
"This heat shield is bigger than a standard halogen bulb but it's also a very strong one.

"Although this item does have a built in case, you can either keep it in the trunk or use a pair of the same size, but the trunk is a bit more sturdy. I like it. It's not waterproof so it stays cold for long periods of time.",0
This unit works fine and the only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is that I would have preferred to purchase the one-button model but it wasn't available at a reasonable price.,1
"I am looking so forward to more books by this author.

Thanks for the opportunity to read this book.  The author, Danielle Hutton, is a wonderful writer.I enjoyed this book.  It was good, but it had some issues with the story.

It is not as thick as I was expecting it to be, but it is thin enough for me to wear in the holster. It is very well made and feels great. I have used this holster on a few occasions and it has held up well. The only complaint I have is that the holster is a little big. I have a large waist and this fit me perfectly.

However, the large was actually a little baggy in the legs! This was perfect for me, because I bought them to turn into shorts, but if I had wanted them to remain pants then I would have either needed a medium or to take the legs in. The waistband was perfect (my stomach is where my weight gain has happened), so they will make perfect shorts.

These may be flatware designed for hikers/campers, but they are still flatware. And at this price, I'd expect their design to be more tasteful. Any branding should be on the back, in an inconspicuous location (the same as any 20 piece, $10, set of flatware for four from wally world).

They were also packages in a fashion that allowed for them to rub against each other during transit, causing abrasion marks. Rolling them in a simple piece of paper could've have seen them to my door in better shape!

Predictable outcome but the story woven around it was good. Would have liked a little more time spent on developing the emotional connection between the two.  Enjoyed the movie none-the-less.,1
"I didn't have very high expectations for this book. The combination of teen romance and historical fiction made me nervous that I would be cringing the whole way through. Fortunately, the author did her research and the result is a fairly accurate portrayal of life in a convent in Renaissance Italy, with a splash of magical realism. The romance elements don't really kick in until the halfway mark, leaving most of the book to focus on other aspects of the protagonist's life, what romance there is isn't overbearing or unrealistic. A plot twist 3/4 through helps keep things fresh with an unexpected change of setting for the final act. The book is largely well-written, but there are some poor descriptive techniques scattered about (""as cold as January"" was a particularly bland simile that stuck in my mind).

Where the book disappoints is in the drama. Most elements of the plot had me wondering why these characters care even half as much as they apparently do. The protagonist is a 17-year-old illegitimate daughter of a recently-deceased nobleman who's been sent by her step-mother to live in a convent. This is problematic for our hero because the only thing she wants on this world is to find a man to marry. A more charitable reviewer would say that she's realistically very focused given the options for those in her situation, but her one-track-mind struck me as obsessive and overly dramatic. The aforementioned plot twist is fairly transparent (if you're expecting a twist), and the while the MacGuffin around which the twist is centered may be historically accurate in terms of its importance, it seemed fairly trivial to me and fed into the overall feeling of unnecessary drama.

The protagonist's personal conflicts are sure to resonate with many readers, particularly girls around her age and younger. Readers who have an interest in art, particularly painting, might understand the drama better, and will definitely appreciate the author's descriptions of the art and architecture. The ending could be interpreted as slightly preachy, but it doesn't detract from the book.",1

I previously had a homemade file server (basically an old 700MHz Compaq PC with two 500GB hdds installed, running Ubuntu Server).  This Dlink just sips the power.  I measured both the old server vs the Dlink DNS-325 using a Kill-a-watt.  Here are my findings:

My old server was using ~ 72.5 W.  The DNS-325 used 8 W (3.5 while asleep).

My old server used 13.96 kWh over 209 hrs.  The DNS-325 used 0.14 kWh over 24.39 hrs.

My old server cost roughly $4.26 per month to operate.  The DNS-325 should cost at most 37 cents.  It will be less than half that if I allow it to sleep.

This Dlink uses less than 1/10 the power that my old file server used.  It will pay for itself in less than three years.",1

I have to say this thing has done exactly what I needed it to do.  B/w my wife and my two kids, there's no telling who will be feeding our dog day-to-day... I used the double sided tape to put it up on the garage wall above the dog food and it doesn't seem to matter who feeds her, we all consistently remember to slide the tab.

"I ordered 4 boxes. Three basically had the same commons in all three boxes and there were easily 30-60 of any given card. The 4th box was mostly Blue (cards massively repeated, many over copies) and the rest of the commons were green. The commons were mostly junk commons (no lightning bolts/shocks/wild growth/counterspell type cards). One box came with 2-3 rares. The others had 4 or 5 but they were largely repeated across boxes. Some uncommon came in sets of four to fourteen. (4 of 11 or more copies) Nothing exceptional. I must have enough prodigal sorcerers by now to assure that they could go into every blue deck I will ever make again without ever reusing any of them. Condition was also an issue on more cards than I expected. The patterns of the commons almost made the repeats seem intentional, especially where five different cards would repeat 6-8 times in one section and then again later. All four boxes were underfilled. Don't waste your money or your time. These doesn't even make for a good beginner's collection because it lacks most of Magic's most important commons. No counterspell in four boxes???? Really? Oh and expect about 20 Circles of Protection. They've been printed in a lot of sets. At least there were 6-10 Healing Salves. Oh, and in 4 boxes, 1 Raging Goblin, which has been reprinted so many times it should be in every box. No basic land, so there is that.",1

"With Mr. Bryson, its not clear what the author's purpose was in writing this book. If he is so inclined, it would be to give readers the opportunity to experience a deeper understanding of the family and its influence in the life of the characters. This is a wonderful book for young people to read as they grow up and develop their own lives and interests. It also provides a good book for adults to read to their children and their families. I loved this book. It was written in a very easy to understand style, and I'm not sure why I was so excited to read it. I like that the story is not over at the end, but the book is written as if it was, and I hope there is a sequel. I also like that it was written in a little more style, as the characters seem more real. I liked how the author used the example of a priest who had a kid with his own problems. I also liked how the author used the word ""con"" to describe the kids. The book was written in a very easy to understand style, and I was excited to read it. I have never read a book that was written in such a simple style, and this book is perfect for that. I will say, I was very impressed with this book. It was very descriptive and well written. I read it because I love the John Grisham series and would love to see this one come to fruition. This was a very easy read, I didn't have to put it down.",0

"I think like many book series, you can't start mid-series. I read many glowing reviews of this book and most of them mention the previous books. Coming into this fresh (I'd not heard of Joe R. Lansdale), the characters and the plot seemed very thin, although the earlier books probably established these elements. When I first started the book, it seemed like a strange amalgam of political correctness, graphic violence, and Fletch-like irreverence. As the story progresses, however, dreadful scene piles on dreadful scene until the book comes across as truly sadistic.

There is an ugly American (Billy) who seeks to humiliate a Mexican girl in the most unpleasant and crude matter. The reader endures many pages of this behavior. I suppose these scenes are intended to justify Hap and Leonard brutally assaulting this guy again and again and again. Finally, Hap literally spreads his own feces on Billy's face, beats him, and makes him stand in the corner. And then does it again. This comes in a scene right after our ""heroes"" discover a girl that's been dismembered with a machete. The reader is treated to an explanation of where the individual pieces of the girl are located about the hotel room. The graphic violence continues up until the final chapter of the novel.

Oh, did I mention that the book opens with a brutal beating of another girl whom Hap saves?  Unfortunately for the girl, Hap doesn't save her until after she's been repeatedly raped, had her face ""stomped in,"" her nipple bitten off, jaw crushed, teeth knocked out, and lost an eye.

Or does the thought of unleashing the cat underneath his skin make her purr?

A thrilling, sensual story that will have you on the edge of your seat with nonstop action, I enjoyed every minute of Touch of Seduction by Rhyannon Bryd. For readers of paranormal romance, it's a first-class adventure from beginning to the end.

These sets work well and are an easy way to add a little safety to your home. The other two sets are a bit pricey. The basic design of the set is pretty straight forward and well made.

He leaves to discuss divorce settlements with his wife and Sheila just knows that she will not be able to do without the drugs while he is gone. Meanwhile checking the mail she finds a threatening letter.

Lying to her Uncle who monitors her money, gives her $100 ....off to buy her drugs and returning to her apartment she finds a dead body in her living room.  Panic of course sets in as she is in possesion of drugs. so the story takes off.  Shelia doesn't want her Uncle to control her life so looks in the yellow pages for lawyers and finds Steve Winslow, an actor who graduated from law school but had never practiced law.

The story at times is funny, this lawyer who has never even been in a court room in a high profile trial.  Well many twists and turns, then a side story about finding out who is Shelia's father.  Without telling the end of the story and trial, the search for Shelia;s father is unclear ....would I read another book, yes probably.",1

"good picture, very weak audio. Overall, the movie is good but not spectacular. Some of the other reviews have stated the movie is a bit too light and not as great as it should be. It is in good shape, and it is not very heavy. The sound is mostly a 2. 0 Dolby Digital sound, but the picture quality is excellent. Overall, I would give it 5 stars. But if you like the movie, buy it. Buy it. It is a good movie. I will definitely watch it again. This movie is a great Christmas gift. I do recommend it to others. This is a very good movie. I like it and I love the ""raw"" look of the movie. I also like the special effects and the story line. It is not the best of the bunch.",0
"This was a very entertaining read.  I enjoyed hearing the adventures that the two main characters had in their lives.  It was a surprise to read of the extreme illness that Robert Louis Stevenson endured.  And, without his wife he probably wouldn't have lived as long as he did.  The story from her perspective took a dark turn near the end which was a surprise too.",1
I loved the ingenuity of Red what a wonderful character. The gentleness of Micah with Shannon. The easy openness and sharing of them both. I was pleasantly surprised by the intrigue toward the end of the story. So very typical of how God works in the lives of the Believer. He has everything under control. Thank you for a great read.,1

"Arrived right on schedule - well packaged - this fan will literally blow you away.  It's somewhat heavy but appears very well made.  Assembly was a snap. I used toggle bolts to mount the bracket to the wall (3/16 x 3"") - I did need to open the holes in the bracket with a 3/16 drill bit - I always use toggle bolts when hanging something on a sheet rock wall and want to make sure the anchors don't loosen up or pull through.  As far as the downward angle - the downward tilt is about 45 degrees maximum - of you are looking for a fan that will tilt down further (like parallel to the floor), this is not the one. Otherwise this is an excellent buy.  The pull string on/off mechanism works very well - changes speed easily - no yanking. The 18"" diameter gives great air movement (not sure how many CFPM).  Checked the big box stores and couldn't find a fan that could compare. One home store carries a wall mounted fan that may be close in size and air movement, but costs over $200.",1

"""Tonight or Never"" is one of the ten best movies about opera ever made (There have been at least 10, right?  There is ""A Night at the Opera"" and ""The Great Caruso,"" and they go to an opera in ""Pretty Woman. ""  Does that count?). Gloria Swanson plays Nella Vago, a young singer who has a rather disappointing operatic debut in Venice. Her voice teacher, Rudig (Gerdinand Gottschalk), tell here that her voice lacks warmth and feeling. Meanwhile, a young man (Melyvn Douglas) is following her around everything. Nella returns home to Budapest, where she learns that a scout from the Metropolitan Opera has refused to sign her until she can truly feel her songs. Depressed, she goes to the apartment of the young man and makes love to him. The next night Nella stuns the audience with her emotional performance in ""Tosca. ""  But now she has to choose between a career and the man she loves (apparently having both does not occur to her). Swanson is pretty good in this early talkie, especially since she is dressed up in stunning gowns by Coco Chanel, which may well be the best part of the movie. This 1931 film directed by Mervyn LeRoy was based on the play by Lili Hatvany and this would be a much better movie if it seemed less like a play. Two other interesting tidbits about ""Tonight or Never"": The cameraman was Gregg Toland, the famous cinematographer who worked with Orson Welles on ""Citizen Kane"" and the scene stealing waiter was Boris Karloff, in his first role after ""Frankenstein.",1

Kyle is a legitimate cowboy, a Texan, and a ""good ol' boy"". He's the sort of guy that you would really like to buy a beer and it shows through his writing.

Fabulous series of books. Finished them all as quickly as I could. This story grabs & holds on for dear life. Only suggestion would have been to condense the series from 8 books to 5.

"My plecostomus devour these (API) algae wafers in no time flat. They apparently love the taste. I feed them these daily and occasionally give them some fresh zucchini. I like that the wafers settle on the bottom of the tank quickly and dissolve easily. However, they do cloud the water a bit, but that is to be expected especially if you have any light, natural or artificial, since light grows algae. My tank sits near a window, so it does get some natural sun, so a little algae is inevitable and doesnt really bother me. I just embrace the fact that sometimes the water doesnt look clean. And finally, these wafers aren't terribly expensive, they will run you a little over $6 for a 3.7 oz container. Because of the size of mine (about 1 foot and a half each), I go thru about a container in a little over a month. Regardless, these algae wafers seem to make them happy.

"I've never read a book that so completely makes a mountain out
of a molehill of non-existent ""evidence."" This book requires
dozens of traitors to be involved(Marshall, Stark, etc. etc.), unless Stinnet thinks FDR
was intercepting and decoding those msgs by his fireside using a English-Japanese dictionary and a copy of the Japanese codes.
The evidence is absolutely overwhelming  and incontrovertible , both from participants as well as Japanese witnesses interviewed
after the war that the author of this book is out to lunch, and trying to make a quick buck with a lurid tale. Even the logic of
allowing the US fleet to be caught unaware makes no sense whatsoever - if the Japanese bomb Pearl arbor, whether it's ready or not, that means war. FDR would have gained absolutely nothing by allowing the attack to succeed. It also could have been far worse had the attack destroyed the fuel farms, which they would have except for Nagumo's trepidation. And that would have put the Pacific Fleet back on the West Coast and immobile for a year. Nor was their any reason to believe that Hitler would declare war on the US as a result, as claimed. The Japanese didn't go to war with Russia (which Hitler strongly wished) just because Japan's partner Germany had. So how is war with Japan going to result in a war with Germany? It depended on Hitler, who had no good reason to declare war on the US. He was stupid to have done so.",1
"Kian goes from being a playboy and ""the spare"" to Crown Prince in the blink of an eye when his twin brothe, Garrett, is kidnapped. For three agonizing months he's been drowning in fear and sorrow over his brother's plight yet having to put on his princely face and perform his princely duty. He's just about reached his breaking point when Savvy stumbles, lierally, into his life. She goes from saving him from a handsy title seeking woman and her daughter to saving his sanity. Savannah Breslin has ""been there, done a prince before"" routine and it broke her heart. She wants to protect her heart but being with His Royal Hotness breaks down her defenses. In turn Savvy becomes his anchor in the tumultuous storm of his brother's disappearance.  Duty keeps calling Kian away and his brother is finally rescued it seems he's pulled away from her more. Even though he's told her he loves her, she believes that they will never have a future because she is an American commoner. So she runs away to protect herself and deal with her breaking heart. Kian finds her and declares his love again backing it up with proposing. It seems this time she will get her prince and her happily ever after.

Tracy Wolff did a great job in combining two storylines: the hot and heavy romance of Kian and Savvy and Kian's journey through the kidnapping and rescue of Garrett. As Kian experiences the angst, anger, rage and impotence of not being able to find his twin, the reader experiences the poer of those feelings right along with him. The sizzle between Savvy and Kian is palpable and practically leaps of the page. I thoroughly enjoyed this romance and am looking forwarx to reading Garrett's story..",1

You could literally feel the tension in this book.  It grew to exploding.

I think my favorite scene may have been the cookie frosting scene.  :)

I loved the happily ever after ending.  It ended just how it was supposed to to make my world happy.

I first picked this book up because Entangled started this Bliss line and it was pretty clean as far as romances go.  I don't know what's happened but for me, a lot of the Bliss line books have crossed over and include scenes that are definitely not clean in my opinion.  And yes, I realize this is a very subjective topic.  I'm just giving my opinion on the matter.  In this book there are sexual situations, the outright sex is not described, but things leading up to it are.  If you don't mind that, this might be the book for you.  However, if you are looking for a ""clean"" romance, this is probably not the book for you.  There is also some swearing.",1

"I like these pants a lot. The quality is good.

The only reason I ordered a size 6.5 is because I thought they would be too tight. They were fine but it was too tight. I would have liked to have ordered a size 7.5 but I would have given them a 6.5 because I'm a big girl and these fit so well. They are cute though. I'm not sure if they will stretch as I wear them out of the house though. I would probably order the smaller size, but I'm not sure how long it will hold up.

If you have a wide butt, it is not as big as I thought it would be. I'm 5'4"" and 140lbs, and the shirt I ordered had a nice, long sleeves. I have a very small chest, so I would have ordered a medium. It was too big for me. I would have gotten a medium. I think I might order a half size up.

Will definitely be buying more of this product in the future.I have purchased these shoes for my husband for our wedding",0
"Whoever designed this simple, yet CRITICAL piece of gear should be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.  I love my cattle dog mix, even though she is an on-the-go-pooper.  One every walk.  Usually within the first 5 minutes of a 30-45 minute walk.  Being a responsible dog owner, I carry the bags and then had to use that knot/leash hold maneuver to carry her deposit to a proper repository.  Two months ago, we adopted a second cattle dog mix and now I have a leash in each hand while I walk the poopingest dogs in the world.  Bag juggle??? Not so much.

So I searched for a solution and I found this simple, yet AMAZING solution.  It's durable and can't imagine it will take years for the rubber to stretch out and give way.  I have one for each leash making it much safer to walk them because I've got positive control of the leashes.  I sent one to my aunt and one to my mom for their dogs.  I suggested my dog walker to charge each client a one time fee to get one for each of her walking clients.

The dog accessory industry is so vast, yet this is one of the must underrated necessities.  I have NEVER found anything like this in stores.  I'm glad someone thought of making them.  Bravo Alcott.... Bravo.",1

I use these almost every day. The only problem is that they are too small for my desk.,0
"""Anatomy Of An Affair"" is a sweet, sweet, romantic story about love, loss, and the past.  The story is told from both Finn and Carrie's point of view, and is written in a way that leaves the reader feeling as though the characters are fully developed.  The characters are strong, likable, and likable.  There is a lot of angst and angst.  There are moments of anger, betrayal, and even forgiveness.  It's very refreshing to have a story that is about a man who has been hurt, and he has a chance to redeem himself.  The romance is sweet, and the story is not over.  The characters are likable, and the story is well written.  I loved the story and look forward to reading more from this author.I received an ARC",0
"Saw Jaws in 75' when I was 7 and then Grizzly came out in 76', the time was about 6-8 months between these two films and it was plain to see this movie was a cash in on the killer animal craze that ran through the mid to late 70s starting with the famous Spielburg film. Stars Christopher George as the park ranger , Richard Jaeckel as a naturalist and Andrew Prine as a vietnam vet running a helicopter service. A 18 foot two thousand pound grizzly goes on the rampage taking out campers , a couple of park rangers before coming to the final showdown with the George character who instead of a scuba tank uses a Lors rocket launcher to destroy the bear. I still enjoy watching it after all these years could have given it 5 stars but that might be pushing it a bit to far. This 2 disc edtion is far better than a earlier version I brought. Remastered with interviews with cast members , trailers and photo gallery shots. I found the interviews with the 2005 screening of the film a bit odd as these people seemed to be on another planet to me but all in all a well made and put together edtion.",1
"Gave them several tries. Made sure tile was clean, suction cups were clean, suction properly applied. No go. Cannot recommend. They're in the trash.",1
I bought this for my boyfriend. It looks great and seems to be durable and of good quality.,1
Works great. Easy to install and has the right tools. works great.,0
"Works okay. The pistol is very hard to cock. The rifle shootsway off sights and there is no way to make it more accurate. I have woodpeckers that decide to take up residence from time to time. It is close enough to frighten them, but not close enough to hit one for a lasting lesson. They are usually about 60 feet away, so this is some serious inaccuracy.",1
This is what Santa brought us. The pieces are sturdy and the puzzle is beautiful. I'm very pleased with the quality of the puzzle. The pieces are very sturdy and the pieces are easy to put together.

"****No Spoilers ****
May be her last book, but it is a great book for a beginner.  It is so easy to read and so easy to get through.  It is very easy to follow and it is very easy to understand.  I have not read any other books in this series and have found them to be the most enjoyable.  I have not read a single book in this series.  This book is a must read for any young adult.  I would recommend this book to any young adult who wants to learn about the world of math and its workings.

I received a copy of this book for free from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.  I am disclosing this in the hopes of giving it as a gift to my family and friends.

This is my honest review of this book.  I have read all of the Spoilers and have no doubt that I have read all of",0
A bit difficult to get into.  Wording seems as though the author has English as a second language. Poor editing.  Mistakes in grammar and misplacement of words.  Eventually grabs you to reach the end.,1

"I chose this food because it has the quality ingredients. I will keep feeding it to my cats.I bought this for a friend who has a small dog and she had a very sensitive ear. She had no issues with it, which was great. This was recommended to me by her veterinarian and it's great for her!

I had to take it to a vet and she told me to give it to her dog as it is sensitive and sensitive. It's very easy to put on and take off and works well. She will bark when she hears it, she just doesn't seem to mind it. I like that it's soft and doesn't have a lot of stuffing, but I like that it's a bit small for her. I can't tell you how many times I've used it! I have a very small dog and I have to worry about her getting too close to it. I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a treat to help calm their dog. The dog is a senior dog and I'm always checking her to see if she's happy or upset, and she's very happy and happy! The dog is a lab mix and it's nice to have a",0

I loved this book it made me smile and cry one of his best! Can't wait to read the next book.,1
Worth the extra money to buy the color screen.  My 88 year old father-in-law loves this!,1
All I can say is please don't let the story die - so many possibilities for all of the characters - A well written and exciting read on so many levels - histoically and romantically with fantasy thrown in for good measure,1
"I thought I was buying this to make it easier for me to cook. My hubby was so excited to try it that he's taken it over and I haven't cooked in it once. It's made it even easier than I thought to make dinner! ;-)
It also works really well for crafty things. My daughters and I have used the keep warm feature to make our own lip balm and hard lotion bars, which were really nice Christmas gifts.",1
"Good product for value. I washed it in our (newer GE model) top load washing machine with agitator in cold water. I was a little confused when it said wash at 140 F - like was it required that I washed it at that temp? I know it sounds ridiculous, but I was confused. I washed it in cold water and it was completely fine. I also dried on the low heat setting in our dryer and it was completely fine as well.",1
"I bought this light several months  ago, it has been in use on a dusk to dawn sensor since then, it has worked exactly as advertised so far. The light color is quite white, at least 5000K but as an outdoor l flood light it has been excellent.",1
"I've had a pair of this for the last two years and it's still going strong.  The other pair I had was the same issue and they have improved the sound a lot.  I'm not sure how much of a improvement they can make but I don't think they should.  They sound great and I'm pleased with the sound.  If I had to guess, I'd say the sound quality is decent.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because they are very small, but I'd be happy with them if they were small enough.

I'm not sure if the speaker is that bad because it's only about 10"" wide.  The reason I give this 5 stars is because I don't like the way the sound is wired.  I was able to find some cable that worked for the price but I never heard of it.  If I had known that I could just buy a different cable that worked, I'd probably buy a different set of speakers.

UPDATE:  I contacted the seller to see if they would send me a replacement pair of speakers.  They told me that they would not and I was able to order one of these.  I was able to send them a replacement pair of speakers but I still have a problem.

The speakers sound great and I'm happy with the sound.  The only downside is that I don't like the way the bass is wired.",0

Flury grabs you right away with mysterious journals and a strangely strict grandmother.  There are strange things in the woods and even stranger family. Oliver has a lot to figure out!
A very well written Christmas story/mystery!",1
"Now I know this is a typical use for gym flooring or under excercise equipment,  but how about its use in camping?  Well my truck is where I sleep when I go camping but let me tell you how uuncomfortable it is to climb in and out of or sleep in the bed....until now.  I just measured the bed and bought enought matting to cover it, the finger joints let me to finish the edges and the fingers all connect well so there are mo gaps.  This has made camping much more enjoyable and comfortable. ..after all not just for excercise any more.",1

"We have had this for a year which is a pretty good length of time for a bath toy in our house. My boys got this as a gift from a friend for Christmas in 2014. It came without the suction cups to attach it, but I have  a textured tub so it  probably wouldn't have worked anyway. One of my sons has played with this pretty frequently, just sitting it on the ledge of the tub. He mostly pretended, because for it to work it has to be partially in the water. The floating gup that came with this was total crap and grew mold inside it, so I had to throw it out in the first month. The roller ripped in the first week, so out it went too. The rest of the unit has stayed functional, so we kept it. I am careful to squeeze the water out of it until no water squirts out after each bath use. But finally last week,  I noticed the blue tubing looked funny. I cut it open and it was growing black mold inside it. So I cut off the tubing and had to pry the plastic shower head off to get it all off. I then told my kid he could play with the housing like that since now water won't collect in it to grow mold. It is a fun toy, but designed very poorly for emptying. It will grow mold, no matter what you do..... it's just a matter of time.",1
"This was a really good book. The characters were well developed and the plot was well written. The story was told very well. The characters were interesting and you felt like you were part of the story. It was a good read. I can't imagine what to say about this book. I'm not a fan of most of the books in the series. But I love this one. This book is a must read for any fan of all time. I'm not going to spoil it for anyone, but I will say that it is a well written book. It has lots of twists and turns that make you want to read more. It is a fun read.",0

It's good for them, especially for dogs with sensitive stomachs. I love that it's made in the USA and I can trust the quality. It's also made in the USA, so I'm happy it's made in the USA. This is a great product for dogs that need to be chewed up, but they like it. They just cut them off with their teeth.",0

I love these dot markers! My 3 year old daughter likes to dot and drag rather than simply dot. Other brands of dot markers were easily ruined and now leak heavily when used. I'm not worried about these because the tip appears to be cloth rather than foam. The colors are also very vibrant and you get 8 markers rather than the usual 6 pack offered by other brands. Very happy with this purchase!,1

"Our 9-year-old, 3# Yorkie and 65# Shepard mix love this new Science Diet canned dog food! We currently feed them a high quality, pure, grain-free dry and wet dog food, so purchasing a case of Science Diet on Amazon was still cheaper than buying from our vet or our local pet shop, and a good value for us.

Our Yorkie is usually a very picky eater and she didn't hesitate to wolf down this new Chicken and Veggie Science Diet dog food with great enthusiasm. We do mix this SD dog food with their $50 a bag Blue Wilderness dry food, so it lasts longer and provides them with all the nutrition they need to stay active and healthy. So far we haven't had any digestive issues and our dogs love it!",1

"Love, Life and Everything Else (Cora Deleuze's book)

The Clue is a short book that is packed with information and then the beginning of a great story. The story begins with the main characters, Stephanie, and Tori. Stephanie is a teacher in her first year. She is a widow and has been engaged to a man named Henry since her husband died. They live in a small apartment on the edge of town, but all that changes when she finds out about his father's death. The story continues with Stephanie, Tori, Stephanie's best friend, and Stephanie's best friend. Stephanie is a recovering addict and is not sure if she will survive the ordeal of being in the hospital, or if she will be able to find a new life.

This is a good story with lots of information and with good characters. There are a few surprises along the way. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good story that is not predictable. The characters are well developed, the story is well written and the plot is well written. The only thing I would change is that I will be reading more of these stories by this author.I have enjoyed all of the books in this series.  I have read all the books and will continue to do so",0
This is an absolutely wonderful toy. The pieces are sturdy and the quality is great. I recommend this toy. Great price! I am a huge fan of Tootlemania and this is by far my favorite. Highly recommend. I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it and it's great for her to keep her stuffed animals in the bath. I wish I could get more.,0
